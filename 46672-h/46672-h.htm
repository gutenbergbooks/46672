<div class="sidenote">1422.</div>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 1.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Buchan lib. 10.</i></div>

<p>After that death had bereft the world of that noble prince king Henrie the fift,
his onelie sonne prince Henrie, being of the age of nine moneths, or thereabouts,
with the sound of trumpets was openlie proclamed king of England and France the
thirtith daie of August, by the name of Henrie the sixt; in the yeare of the world
fiue thousand, thr&eacute;e hundred, eightie and nine, after the birth of our Sauiour 1422,
about the twelfe yeare of the emperour Frederike the third, the fortith and two and
last of Charles the sixt, and the third yeare of Mordaks regiment (after his father
Robert) gouernour of Scotland. The custodie of this yoong prince was appointed to
Thomas duke of Excester, &amp; to Henrie Beauford bishop of Winchester. The duke of
Bedford was deputed regent of France, and the duke of Glocester was ordeined protectour
of England; who taking vpon him that office, called to him wise and graue
councellors, by whose aduise he prouided and tooke order as well for the good gouernment
of the realme &amp; subiects of the same at home, as also for the maintenance of
the warres abroad, and further conquest to be made in France, appointing valiant and
expert capteins, which should be readie, when n&eacute;ed required. Besides this, he gathered
great summes of monie to mainteine men of warre, and left nothing forgotten that
might aduance the good estate of the realme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>While these things were a dooing in England, the duke of Bedford regent of France
studied most earnestlie, not onelie to k&eacute;epe and well order the countries by king
Henrie late conquered; but also determined not to leaue off warre &amp; trauell, till Charles
the Dolphin (which was now aflote, because king Charles his father in the moneth of
October in this present yeare was departed to God) should either be subdued, or
brought to obeisance. And suerlie the death of this king Charles caused alterations
in France. For a great manie of the nobilitie, which before, either for feare of the
English puissance, or for the loue of this king Charles (whose authoritie they followed)
held on the English part, did now reuolt to the Dolphin, with all indeuour to driue
the English nation out of the French territories. Whereto they were the more earnestlie
bent, and thought it a thing of greater facilitie, because of king Henries yoong
yeares; whome (because he was a child) they est&eacute;emed not, but with one consent
reuolted from their sworne fealtie: as the recorder of the Englishmens battels with
forren nations, verie aptlie doth note, saieng:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">H&icirc;c Franci puerum regem neglectui habentes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desciscunt, viol&aacute;tque fidem gens perfida sacro<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consilio ante datam.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The duke of Bedford being greatlie mooued with these sudden changes, fortified
his townes both with garrisons of men, munition, and vittels, assembled also a great
armie of Englishmen and Normans, and so effectuouslie exhorted them to continue
faithfull to their liege and lawfull lord yoong king Henrie, that manie of the French
capteins willinglie sware to king Henrie fealtie and obedience, by whose example the
communaltie did the same. Thus the people quieted, and the countrie established in
order, nothing was minded but warre, and nothing spoken of but conquest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pont Meulan surprised by the Fre&#x0304;ch.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1423.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Enguerant.</i></div>

<p>The Dolphin which lay the same time in the citie of Poitiers, after his fathers
deceasse, caused himselfe to be proclamed king of France, by the name of Charles
the seuenth: and in good hope to recouer his patrimonie, with an haultie courage
preparing war, assembled a great armie: and first the warre began by light skirmishes,
but after it grew into maine battels. The Dolphin thinking not to lose anie occasions
of well dooing, sent the lord Grauile to the towne of Pont Meulan, standing on the
riuer of Seine, who comming to the same vpon the sudden, the fourt&eacute;enth of Ianuarie,
tooke it and slue a great number of English souldiors, which he found within it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Grauile falsified his oth.</div>

<p>When the duke of Bedford the regent, aduertised of this sudden surprise, appointed
the lord Thomas Montacute earle of Salisburie (a man both for policie and
courage, liker to the old Romans than to men of his daies) accompanied with the
earle of Suffolke, the lord Scales, the yoong lord Poinings, sir Iohn Fastolfe maister
of the houshold, with himselfe and diuerse others, to besiege the said towne of
Pont Meulan, which after two moneths siege was rendred to the said earle, and the
lord Grauile sware to be true to the king of England euer after that day: but shortlie
after, forgetting his oth, he turned French againe.</p>

<p>The earle of Salisburie appointed sir Henrie Mortimer, and sir Richard Vernon,
capteins of the towne, and from thence went into Champaigne, and there besieged
the towne of Sens, tooke it, and sir William Marin the capteine within it, and slue
all the souldiors that kept it, made capteins there sir Hugh Godding, and sir Richard
Aubemond. &para; In this season, Humfrie duke of Glocester, either striken in loue, or
vpon some other occasion, maried the ladie Iaquet or Iaquelin, daughter and sole heire
to William of Bauier duke of Holland, which was lawfull wife to Iohn duke of
Brabant then liuing, who afterwards (as after ye shall heare) recouered hir out of
the dukes hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Affinitie an interteiner of friendship.</div>

<p>The chances thus happening (as you before haue heard) Iohn duke of Bedford,
Philip duke of Burgognie, and Iohn duke of Britaine made a fr&eacute;endlie m&eacute;eting in
the citie of Amiens, where they renewed the old league and ancient amitie made
betw&eacute;ene the noble prince king Henrie the fift and them, adding thereto these conditions
and agr&eacute;ements, ech of them to be to the other fr&eacute;end and aider; and the
enimie of the one to be enimie to the other; and all they to be fr&eacute;ends and aiders
to the king of England, welwiller to his welwillers, and aduersarie to his aduersaries.
And (bicause that affinitie is commonlie the bond of amitie) there was concluded
a mariage betw&eacute;ene the duke of Bedford, and the ladie Anne sister to the
duke of Burgognie, which was after solemnized at Trois in Champaigne, in the presence
of the duke of Burgognie brother to the bride, and of hir vncle the duke of
Brabant, the earles of Salisburie and Suffolke, and of nine hundred lords, knights,
and esquiers, with such feast and triumph, as before that time had not b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene of
the Burgognions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Parisiens preuented of their practises.</div>

<p>Whilest these matters were in hand, the Parisiens, thinking to blind the eies of
the duke of Bedford, wrote to him how diuerse castels and fortresses lieng about their
territories, were replenished with their enimies, dailie stopping their passages, and
robbing their merchants, to their vtter vndooing, if they by his helpe were not relieued.
But this was but a glose of the Parisiens, meaning to cause him to go
about the winning of some strong hold, whilest they in his absence might bring
into the citie Charles the Dolphin, that then called himselfe French king; for so
had they appointed, assigning to him the daie of his comming, and the post of his
entrie. But their practise being discouered to the duke of Bedford, he with a great
power entered into Paris, one daie before the faire was appointed, &amp; two nights before
he was looked for of his enimies being vnprouided, and suddenlie caused the
conspirators within the citie to be apprehended, and openlie to be put to execution.</p>

<p>This doone, putting a mistrust in the Parisiens, he caused the castels and fortresses
n&eacute;ere and adioining to the citie, to be furnished with Englishmen. And to auoid
all night-watchers about Paris, and the confines thereof, he first tooke into his possession
either by assault or composition, the towne of Trainelle and Braie vpon
Seine. And bicause two castels, the one called Pacie, and the other Coursaie were
also euil neighbours to the Parisiens, he sent sir Iohn Fastolfe great maister of his
houshold with a notable armie to win the same castels; which he did, and with
preie and prisoners returned backe againe to his maister the regent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The English armie entreth the riuer and winneth the banke.</div>

<p>In this verie season, the Dolphin sent the lord William Steward earle of Buchquhane
that was constable of France, and the earle of Ventadour in Auuergne, and
manie other noble men of his part, to laie siege to the towne of Crauant in the
countie of Auxerre, within the parts of Burgognie. Wherof hearing the lord regent,
and the duke of Burgognie they assembled a great armie, and appointed the earle
of Salisburie to haue the guiding thereof; who with his capteins and men of warre,
English and Burgognions, came in good arraie to giue battell to the besiegers.
And bicause the riuer of Yonne, which runneth by the said towne, was betw&eacute;ene
the English armie, and their aduersaries, they could not well assaile their enimies,
which defended the bankes and passages verie stronglie: yet notwithstanding, both
horssemen and footmen of the English part couragiouslie put themselues into
the riuer, and with fine force recouered the banke, whome the Burgognions incontinentlie
followed.</p>

<p>When they were all gotten into the plaine, the archers shot, the bill men strake,
and long was the fight in doubtfull balance. But in conclusion the Frenchmen not
able to resist the force of the English nation, were discomfited, slaine, and chased,
leauing a glorious victorie to the Englishmen and Burgognions. There were slaine
of the Frenchmen an eight&eacute;ene hundred knights and esquiers, beside commons: of Scots
n&eacute;ere hand thr&eacute;e thousand. Amongest the Frenchmen these were chiefest that were
slaine: the earle of Lestrake, the earl of Comigens, the earle of Tonnoire, the lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Coquart de Comeron, the bastard of Arminake, the viscount of Touraine, the
bastard of Forrestes, the lord de Port, and the lord Memorancie.</p>

<p>Of Scots the lord of saint Iohns towne, sir Iohn of Balgarie, sir Iohn Turnbull,
sir Iohn Holiburton, sir Robert Lislie, sir William Coningham, sir William Dowglas,
sir Alexander Hume, sir William Lislie, sir Iohn Rotherford, sir William Craiford,
sir Thomas Seton, sir William Hamilton, and his sonne, Iohn Pillot. There were taken
the earle of Buchquhane constable of France, which lost his eie, the earle of Ventadour,
sir Alexander Meldrine, sir Lewes Ferignie, and two and twentie hundred
gentlemen of the French part. Of Englishmen there were slaine sir Iohn Greie, sir
William Hall, sir Gilbert Halsall one of the marshals of the field, Richard ap Madocke,
and one and twentie hundred souldiers and men of warre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 2</div>

<p>After this fortunate victorie was the earle of Salisburie made (by the lord regent)
lieutenant and vicegerent for the king and the said lord regent in the countries of
France, Brie, and Champaigne; and sir Iohn Fastolf was substituted deputie vnder
the lord regent within the duchie of Normandie on this side the riuer of Seine;
and withall he was also made gouernour of the countries of Aniou and Maine. The
earle of Salisburie after fiue moneths siege, wan by surrender the towne and castell
of Montaguillon in Brie; the capteins whereof, the one named Pregent of Cotinie,
and Guille Bourgois Britons, sware neuer to beare armour against the Englishmen
on this side the riuer of Loire. In the mean time of that siege, the earle of Suffolke
tooke by force the castell of Coucie, and the strong castell of la Roch in Masconnois
he got by appointment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1424</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ann. 1423, per Buchanan.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Homage doone by the king of Scotland to king Henrie the sixt.</div>

<p>In this second yeare of king Henrie the sixt, Iames (the first of that name &amp; the
hundred &amp; second K. of Scotland, tooke to wife the ladie Iane, daughter to Iohn
earle of Summerset deceassed, and sister to Iohn then duke of Summerset, and also
coosine germane remoued to king Henrie, and n&eacute;ece to the duke of Winchester, and
to the duke of Excester) was set at libertie, couenanting to paie a small portion of
monie more than was allowed to him for his wiues marriage monie, and left hostages
for the same. But before his departure out of the realme, he did his homage vnto the
the yoong king of England Henrie the sixt at the castell of Windsor, before thr&eacute;e
dukes, two archbishops, twelue earles, ten bishops, twentie barons, and two hundred
knights and esquiers, beside others, in order of words according to the tenour
hereafter following.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><i>Buchan. lib. 10. An. 1425. W. P.</i></div>

<p>But notwithstanding this his oth, and the great bounteous liberalitie of the mother
&amp; vncles of his wife, in bestowing on him abundance of plate &amp; treasure, with rich
clothes of arras; he had not b&eacute;ene long at home, but that soone out of France into
Scotland ouer came there Iames Steward, who (after manie of the Scotish nobilitie
by diuerse occasions in France consumed) grew to be capteine of the horssemen there.
With him came the archbishop of Remes with power and commission for concluding a
league betw&eacute;ene France and Scotland, and also of a mariage betw&eacute;ene Lewes the Dol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>phins
sonne and Margaret Iameses daughter, though both verie yoong. Which
matters acordinglie accomplished, to France againe they got them. So Iames became
as firm French as any of his predecessours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compeigne surrendered to the English by a policie.</div>

<p>But now to leaue the Scotish king amongst his countriemen in Scotland, and returne
to the dooings of England. I find that the duke of Glocester, being protector
and gouernour of the realme, prepared an armie of ten thousand men, and sent them
ouer to his brother the regent into France; who comming into the territorie of Paris,
were ioifullie of him receiued. About the same time the Frenchmen got by stealth
diuerse townes out of the Englishmens hands, and amongst other the faire towne of
Compiegne was one, and the pretie towne of Crotoie an other. When the duke of
Bedford was aduertised hereof, he determined not to let the matter passe in such sort,
but with all conuenient sp&eacute;ed sent foorth a force to recouer these townes againe. And
first the earle of Suffolke with the earle of Lignie, and diuerse other capteins of the
Englishmen went to besiege Compiegne, and lodged on the one side of the riuer of
Sohame, as the lord Lisle Adham, sir Thomas Ramston, and the prouost of Paris
laie on the other side. The Frenchmen within the towne well furnished with good
souldiers, munition, and vittels, couragiouslie defended themselues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compeigne &amp; Crotoie recouered from the French.</div>

<p>The Englishmen remembring that Guilliam Remond, other wise called Mariolaine
had b&eacute;en the leader of the souldiers within the towne (which Mariolaine before at
Pacie was taken prisoner by sir Iohn Fastolfe) caused him to be brought from Paris
vnto the campe, and set him in a chariot with an halter about his necke, and conueied
him to the gibet without the towne, sending word to them within, that if
they would not without delaie render the towne, their capteine should incontinentlie
be strangled afore their faces. Which moued the souldiers so much, by reason of
the loue they bare to their old capteine and gouernour, that for the deliuerance
of him and partlie of themselues they y&eacute;elded the towne, so that both he and they
might depart with horsse and harnesse onelie in sure conduct and safetie. Yet
yer this towne of Compiegne was deliuered, sir Philip Hall, which was sent to Crotoie
by the lord regent with eight hundred men to besiege it, got it suddenlie by
assault yer the Frenchmen had either disposed their garrison, or appointed their
lodgings.</p>

<p>About the same time sir Iohn de la Poole brother to the duke of Suffolke, being
capteine of Auranches in Normandie, assembled all the garrisons of the base marches
of the countrie of Aniou, and came before the citie of Angiers, burnt the suburbes,
spoiled and destroied the whole countrie; and hauing as manie prisoners as his

of Narbonne, and six thousand Frenchmen; which finding the Englishmen out of
araie, incumbred with carriage of their great spoile, suddenlie set on them, gaue
them the ouerthrow, slue thr&eacute;e hundred and tooke manie prisoners; as the said
sir Iohn de la Poole, sir Iohn Basset, Iohn Aufort lieutenant of Faleise, Iohn Clifton,
Henrie Mortimer, and other to the number of six hundred.</p>

<p>But though the Frenchmen got here in this place, they went not awaie with like
gaine in an other: for the bastard de la Baulme, and the lord Craignar capteins
of Courallon, with a great band made rode into Masconnois, whom by chance Matthew
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>Gough and other Englishmen, which were also abroad in the countrie, met
and incountred. There was a sore fight betw&eacute;ene the parties, being of courage
and number in maner equall. But after long conflict, the Frenchmen almost all
were slaine and taken, and the bastard being well horssed, fled; after whome followed
vpon the spurres, Matthew <a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>Gough chasing him euen to his castell gate,
and there tooke him: for the which act he was much praised of the erle of Salisburie

that belonged to the prisoner but also was rewarded with a goodlie courser at the
earles hands.</p>

<p>About this season, Arthur brother to Iohn duke of Britaine, commonlie called
the earle of Richmond, hauing neither profit of the name, nor of the countrie,
notwithstanding that king Henrie the fift had created him earle of Yurie in Normandie,
and gaue him not onelie a great pension, but also the whole profits of
the same towne of Yurie; yet now, bicause that the duke his brother was returned
to the part of the Dolphin, he likewise reuolting from the English obeisance, came
to the Dolphin to Poictiers, and there offered himselfe to serue him, whom the
Dolphin gladlie accepted, reioising more thereof, than if he had gained an hundred
thousand crownes: for the Britons within the towne of Yurie, hearing that their
maister was ioined with the Dolphin, kept both the towne and castell against the
duke of Bedford, furnishing it dailie with new men and munition.</p>

<p>The lord regent aduertised hereof, raised an armie of Englishmen and Normans,
to the number of eight&eacute;ene hundred men of armes, and eight thousand archers and
other. He had in his companie the earles of Salisburie and Suffolke, the lords
Scales, Willoughbie, and Poinings, sir Reginald Graie, sir Iohn Fastolfe, sir Iohn
Saluaine, sir Lancelot Lisle, sir Philip Hall, sir Iohn Pashleie, sir Iohn Greie, sir
Thomas Blunt, sir Robert Harling, sir William Oldhall, and manie other, both knights
and esquiers, with whom he came before the towne of Yurie, which was well defended,
till they within perceiued themselues in danger, by reason of a mine which
the Englishmen made, wherevpon they y&eacute;elded the towne. But the capteins of the
castell would not presentlie render the place, howbeit they promised to deliuer it,
if the same were not rescued at a day assigned by the Dolphin or his power.</p>

<p>Vpon this promise, hostages were deliuered into the possession of the lord regent,
by whose licence an herald was sent to the Dolphin, to aduertise him of the time
determined; who vnderstanding the distresse of his fr&eacute;ends, incontinentlie sent
Iohn duke of Alanson, as his lieutenant generall, the erle Douglas, whome at their
setting foorth he made duke of Touraine, and the earle Buchquhane as then constable
of France, the erls of Aumarle, Ventadoure, Tonnere, Maulieurier, and Forests,
the vicounts of Narbonne, and Touars, the lords of Grauile, Gaules, Malicorne,
Mannie, Ballaie, Fountains, Montfort, and manie other noble knights and esquiers,
to the number of fift&eacute;ene thousand Frenchmen and Britons, besides fiue thousand
Scots, whome the earle Dowglas had but latelie transported out of Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Verneuil gotten from the Englishmen by crediting a lie.</div>

<p>This roiall armie approched within two miles of Yurie. But when the duke of
Alanson understood by such as he had sent to view the conduct of the Englishmen,
that he could not get anie aduantage by assailing them (although the Dolphin had
giuen him streict commandement to fight with the regent) he retired backe with his
whole armie to the towne of Vernueill in Perch, that belonged to the king of England;
sending word to the garrison, that he had discomfited the English armie, and
that the regent with a small number with him by swiftnesse of horsse had saued
himselfe. The inhabitants of Vernueill, giuing too light credit herevnto receiued the
duke of Alanson with all his armie into the towne.</p>

<p>In the meane time came the daie of the rescues of Yurie, which for want thereof
was deliuered to the duke of Bedford by the capteine called Gerard de la Pallier, who
presenting vnto the duke of Bedford the keies of the castell, shewed him a letter also
signed and sealed with the hands and seales of eight&eacute;ene great lords, who the daie
before promised by the tenour of the same letter to giue the duke battell, and to
raise the siege. "Well (said the duke) if their hearts would haue serued, their puissance
was sufficient once to haue proffered, or to haue performed this faithfull promise:
but sith they disdaine to s&eacute;eke me, God and saint George willing, I shall
not desist to follow the tract of their horsses till one part of us be by battell ouerthrowne."
And herewith he sent foorth the earle of Suffolke with six hundred
horssemen, to espie the dooings of the Frenchmen, and where they were lodged. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
earle riding foorth, passed by Dampuile, and came to Bretueill, where he heard certeine
newes where the Frenchman had gotten Verneueill, and remained there still.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ordering of their battels.</div>

<p>These newes he sent by post vnto the duke of Bedford, the which incontinentlie
vpon that aduertisement set forward in great hast towards his enimies. The Frenchmen
hearing of his comming, set their people in arraie, and made all one maine
battell without fore ward or rere ward; and appointed foure hundred horssemen,
Lombards and others to breake the arraie of the Englishmen, either behind, or at
the sides, of the which was capteine sir Stephan de Vinoiles, called the Hire. The
duke of Bedford likewise made one entier battell, and suffered no man to be on
horssebacke, and set the archers (euerie one hauing a sharpe stake) both on the front
of the battell, and also on the sides, like wings. And behind were all their horsses
tied togither, either by the reins or by the tailes, with the carts and cariages, to the
defense whereof were two thousand archers appointed.</p>

<p>H&eacute;erewith either part being come almost to the ioining, the duke of Alanson,
on the one side, exhorted his people to plaie the men, declaring vnto them, that the
conclusion of this battell should either deliuer them out of vile seruitude, or place
them in the vale of bondage. On the other side, the duke of Bedford, to incourage
his men, willed them to remember how oft they had subdued those their aduersaries
in battell (with whome they should now cope) for the most part, euer being the
lesse number against the greater. Againe, he declared how necessarie it was to tame
the bold attempts of the presumptuous Dolphin now in the beginning, least if the fire
were suffered further to burne, it must haue n&eacute;ed of the more water to quench it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The battell of Vernoile the 28 of August, 1424.</div>

<p>Manie words he vttered, to put them in hope of good successe and victorie. But
scarse had he ended his exhortation, when the Englishmen rushed foorth, and boldlie
set on their enimies, crieng, Saint George, a Bedford, a Bedford: and the Frenchmen
likewise cried Montioy saint Denis. Then began the battell right fierce on both sides,
continuing for the space of thr&eacute;e houres in doubtfull balance, fortune shewing hir
selfe so equall, that no eie could iudge to whether part she was more fauourable.
But at length, after that those foure hundred horssemen, which were appointed, as
y&eacute;e haue hard, to brake the arraie of the Englishmen, had passed thorough on the
one side vnto the place where the cariages and horsses stood, and could not passe
further, by reason of the fierce shot of the English bowes, they falling to the spoile
made a hand, and therewith departed. Those archers then that were appointed to
k&eacute;epe the cariages, being now at libertie, came forward, and so fiercelie shot at the
thickest prease of their enimies fighting on foot, that in the end they were not able
longer to indure, but were borne downe by fine force, and so vanquished.</p>

<p>This battell was fought the eight and twentith of August, in the yeare of our
Lord a thousand foure hundred twentie and foure, in the which battell were slaine
of the Frenchmen the earles of Aumarle, Ventadour, Forest, Marie, the lords Grauile,
Gaules, Fountaines, Ambois, Touars, Montenie, Combreste, Brunell, Tumble,
and Poisie, beside thr&eacute;e hundred knights. The vicount Narbonne was hanged on a
gibbet, bicause he was one of the murtherers of the duke of Burgognie. Of Scots
also were slaine, Archembald earle Dowglas, that was made (as before is mentioned)
duke of Touraine, Iames Dowglas sonne to the said Archembald earle of Wicton,
Iohn earle of Bouqhen newlie made constable of France, sir Alexander Meldrin, sir
Henrie Balglauie, sir Iohn Sterling, William of Homelsdon, sir James Graie, sir
Robert Randen, sir Alexander Linsaie, sir Robert Steward, sir Robert Swinton, and
seauen and twentie hundred Scots of name and armes, beside others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fiue thousa&#x0304;d saith <i>Aemilius</i> but <i>Nicholas Giles</i> saith there died but foure thousa&#x0304;d on both parts.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Dudley and Charleton, two of the English nobilitie, were slaine at this battell, as <i>Ia. Meir</i> saith.</div>

<p>So that in this battell were slaine by report of Montioy king at armes in France,
and the English haralds there present, of Frenchmen &amp; Scots nine thousand and
seauen hundred: and of Englishmen one and twentie hundred, but no man of name, sauing
fiue yoong esquiers. And there were taken prisoners, Iohn duke of Alanson, the
bastard of Alanson, the lord of Faiect, the lord of Hormit, sir Piers Harison, sir
Lois de Gaucourt, sir Robert Brusset, sir Iohn Turnebull a Scot, and two hundred
gentlemen, beside common soldiers. The Frenchmen within Vernoill, s&eacute;eing the
Dolphins armie thus ouerthrowne, deliuered the towne to the regent, their liues saued.
Then was sir Philip Hall appointed capteine there, and the lord regent returned, and
came to Rone, and after to Paris.</p>

<p>The Dolphin that called himselfe king of France, was sore appalled with the ouerthrow
of his armie: for he was driuen out of all the countries in maner, that apperteined
to the crowne of France, &amp; might resort to none except to Bourbonois, Aluergne,
Berrie, Poictow, Touraine, a part of Aniow, and Languedoc: yet to shew himselfe
as king, he erected his court of parlement, his chancerie, &amp; all other courts in the
citie of Poictiers, and there established his great seale, with all due circumstances
thereto apperteining: where he continued fouret&eacute;ene yeares togither, and then was
remooued to Paris, after he had got that citie, and expelled the Englishmen, as after
shall appeare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Scales sent to conquer Aniow and Maine.</div>

<p>The duke of Bedford lieng at Paris, sent the lord Scales, sir Iohn Montgomerie,
sir Iohn Fastolfe, with two thousand men to winne the countries of Aniow, and
Maine, vnto whom were rendred without assault, the strong castels of Beaumont le
Vicount, Teune, Sillie, Osce, Courceriers, Roussie, Vasse, Couetemenant, and twentie
other, which I doo h&eacute;ere passe ouer. Such was then the opinion conceiued of the
English puissance, so oft tried, prooued, and preuailing, that the Frenchmen thought
the Englishmen would haue all which they wished for or wrought for.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mans deliuered to the Englishmen.</div>

<p>The earle of Salisburie, with the said lord Scales, and the other capteins before
named, were appointed with an armie of ten thousand men, to besiege the rich and
strong citie of Mans, the ch&eacute;efe citie of all the countrie of Maine; whither when
they came, they made their approches, and planted their batterie to the wals, so that
with the shot of their great p&eacute;eces (which kind of engins before that time had not
b&eacute;ene much s&eacute;ene nor heard of in France) the citie was within a few daies despoiled
of all hir towers and outward defenses. The citizens and soldiers, perceiuing in what
danger they stood, &amp; knowing not how to remedie the matter, offered the towne vpon
this condition, that all persons which would tarrie within the towne, might abide;
and all that would depart with horsse and harnesse onelie, should be permitted: which
offers were accepted, and the towne rendered, whereof the earle made capteine the
earle of Suffolke, and his lieutenant sir Iohn Fastolfe.</p>

<p>After this, the earle of Salisburie besieged the faire towne of saint Susan, whereof
was capteine one Ambrose de Lore, a right valiant ch&eacute;efteine. The earle caused the
towne to be assaulted at his first commmg to it; but he lost more than he gained,
and therefore left off his assaults, and caused a trench to be cast about the towne, and
so planted his batterie, by force whereof he ouerthrew the walles, in such sort that
the capteine offered for himselfe and his soldiers 200000 crownes, so that they might
depart in their doublets onelie, which summe (bicause winter approched) was accepted,
and the towne y&eacute;elded. Of this towne sir Iohn Popham was made capteine. Then
the erle went to Maine la Iuhez, which towne after fiue w&eacute;ekes siege was y&eacute;elded,
and appointed to the k&eacute;eping of sir Iohn Montgomerie, knight.</p>

<p>After the feast of the Purification of our ladie, the earle of Salisburie besieged the
castell de la Fert Barnard; during which siege a sale was made of the towne of Alanson
being in the Englishmens possession, by a Gascoigne that was one of the garrison
there. But this sale being opened to the erle of Salisburie by the same Gascoigne
at the daie appointed, the lord Willoughbie and sir Iohn Fastolfe, with two thousand
men were sent to incounter with the buiers of that towne; so that when Charles de
Villiers ch&eacute;efe merchant of this ware, came earlie in a morning with two hundred
horsemen, and thr&eacute;e hundred footmen, and approached the towne, abiding for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Gascoigne, yer he was aware, the Englishmen had compassed him and his companie
round about, and setting vpon the Frenchmen, slue and tooke all the whole number
of them, saue Peter Danthenazie and fiue and twentie other, which by the swiftnesse
of their horsses saued themselues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Generall processions after victorie.</div>

<p>After this conflict, the lord Willoughbie returned to the earle of Salisburie, lieng
still at siege before the towne de la Fert Barnard, which shortlie after was rendered
vp into the erle of Salisburies hands, to whome the lord regent gaue it, to inioie to
him and his heires for euer. Beside this, the said earle partlie by assalt, &amp; partlie by
composition tooke diuers other, as saint Kales; where he made capteine Richard Gethin
esquier; Thanceaux Lermitage, where he made gouernour Matthew <a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>Gough; Guerland
of the which he assigned ruler Iohn Banaster; Malicorne, whereof he made
capteine William Glasdale esquier; Lisle Soubz Boulton, whereof was made capteine
sir Lancelot Lisle knight; Loupelland, whereof was made capteine Henrie Branch;
Montseur, of the which was made capteine sir William Oldhall knight: la Suze was
assigned to the k&eacute;eping of Iohn Suffolke, esquier. And besides this, aboue fortie
castels and piles were ouerthrowne and destroied. The newes hereof reported in England,
caused great reioising among the people, not onelie for the conquest of so manie
townes &amp; fortresses, but also for that it had pleased God to giue them victorie in a
pitched field: whereof generall processions were appointed, to render vnto God humble
thanks for his fauour so bestowed vpon them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A subsidie of tunnage and poundage.</div>

<p>This yeare after Easter, the king called a parlement at Westminster, by aduise of
the p&eacute;eres; and comming to the parlement house himselfe, he was conueied through
the citie vpon a great courser, with great triumph, the people flocking into the
str&eacute;ets to behold the child, whome they iudged to haue the liuelie image and countenance
of his father, and like to succ&eacute;ed him, and be his heire in all princelie qualities,
martiall policies, and morall vertues, aswell as in his realmes, seigniories and
dominions. In this parlement was granted to the king a subsidie of twelue pence
the pound, towards the maintenance of his warres, of all merchandize, comming in
or going out of the realme, as well of Englishmen as strangers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prince of Portingale commeth to London.</div>

<p>During which parlement, came to London Peter duke of Quimbre, sonne to the
king of Portingale, cousine germane remooued to the king; which of the duke of Excester
and the bishop of Winchester his vncles was highlie feasted, he was also
elected into the order of the garter. During the same season, Edmund Mortimer, the
last earle of March, of that name (which long time had b&eacute;ene restreined from his
libertie, and finallie waxed lame) deceassed without issue, whose inheritance descended
to the lord Richard Plantagenet, sonne and heire to Richard earle of Cambridge, beheaded
(as before y&eacute;e haue heard) at the towne of Southampton. &para; In the time of
this parlement also was sir Iohn Mortimer cousine to the same earle, either for desert
or malice, atteinted of treason, and put to execution, of whose death no small
slander arose amongst the common people.</p>

<p>After all these things doone in England and in France, Humfreie duke of Glocester,
who had married the ladie Iaquet, or Iaqueline of Bauier, countesse of Heinault,
Holland, and Zeland (notwithstanding she was coupled in marriage afore to Iohn
duke of Brabant, as yet liuing, and had continued with him a long space) passed
now the sea with the said ladie, and went to Mons or Bergen in Heinault, where
the more part of the people of that countrie came and submitted themselues vnto him,
as to their souereigne lord, in right of his said wife, the ladie Iaquet or Iaqueline:
with which dooing hir former husband was greatlie mooued. And likewise the duke
of Burgognie, being great friend to the same duke of Brabant, was much offended:
who of old familiaritie wrote louinglie to the duke of Glocester, requiring him to
reforme himselfe according to reason, and to forsake his vngodlie life, both in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>k&eacute;eping of an other mans wife, and also in s&eacute;eking to vsurpe other mens rights and
titles.</p>

<p>Herevpon went letters betwixt them for a time, but at length when the duke of
Burgognie perceiued that the duke of Glocester meant to mainteine his interest, &amp; to
make wane against the duke of Brabant; he tooke part with the duke of Brabant so
earnestlie, that he consented to fight with the duke of Glocester bodie to bodie
within lists in defence of the duke of Brabants quarell, and further aided the duke of
Brabant in his warres against the duke of Glocester, with all his puissance, insomuch
that in the end (after the duke of Glocesters returne into England) the duke of Brabant
recouered all the towns in Heinault, which the ladie Iaquet or Iaqueline held
against him. And further the same ladie was by composition deliuered by them of
the towne of Mons vnto the duke of Burgognie; who caused hir to be conueied vnto
Gant, from whence she made shift to escape into Holland, where she was obeied as
countesse of the countrie.</p>

<p>Then made she warre in hir owne defense against the dukes of Burgognie and Brabant,
who sought to spoile hir of all hir towns and lands: but they procured pope
Martin the fift (before whome the matter was) to giue sentence that the first matrimonie
with the duke of Brabant was good, and the second with the duke of Glocester
to be vnlawfull. But in the meane time, the lord Fitz Walter was sent ouer to
the aid of the ladie Iaquet or Iaquelin, with a power of Englishmen, landed in Zeland,
n&eacute;ere vnto the towne of Zerixe, aginst whome came the duke of Burgognie,
and incountering with them and other such Hollanders and Zelanders, as were ioined
with them, n&eacute;ere to a place called Brewers hauen, there discomfited them; so that
of English, Hollanders, and Zelanders, with the said lord Fitz Walter, were slaine
seauen or eight hundred, and the residue chased to the water. At length, when the
duke of Glocester vnderstood the sentence pronounced against him by the pope, he
began to wax wearie of his wife the said ladie Iaquet, by whome he neuer had profit,
but losse, and tooke in a second marriage Eleanor Cobham, daughter to the lord
Cobham of Sterberow, which before (as the fame went) was his souereigne paramour,
to his slander and dishonour.</p>

<p>A little before this time, sir Thomas Rampston, sir Philip Branch, sir Nicholas
Burdet, and other Englishmen, to the number of fiue hundred men of warre, repared
and fortified the towne of S. Iames de Beuuron, situate on the frontiers of Normandie
towards Britaine, within halfe a league of the duke of Britains ground, with
whome as then they had open warre; and so began to doo manie displeasures to his
people. Wherevpon Arthur earle of Richmont and Yurie, brother to the said duke,
and latelie before created constable of France, assembled an huge power of men to
the number of fortie thousand (as some haue written) and with the same came before
the said towne of S. Iames de Beuuron, and planted his siege verie stronglie about it,
inforcing with his great ordinance to ouerthrow the wals. And one day amongst
other, he determined to giue the assault, and so did, the which continued a long
space verie hot and earnest.</p>

<p>The Britons Britonants were come downe into a low bottome, where there was a
little pond or fish poole, and they must n&eacute;eds passe by a streict waie to come to the
walles in great danger. On that side of the towne was a little bulworke, which sir
Nicholas Burdet kept, hauing with him a fortie or eightie fighting men: and ouer
against the same bulworke there was a gate well furnished also with English souldiers;
so that the Britons which came downe into the ditches in great number to giue the
assault, heard on either side them the Englishmen (within the said bulworke and
gate) make a great noise, in crieng Salisburie and Suffolke; with the which crie the
Britons being maruelouslie astonied, began to recoile in great disorder. And therewith
the said sir Nicholas Burdet issued foorth vpon them, and pursuing them right
valiantlie, slue them downe, so that there died of them what by the sword, and
what by drowning in the said poole, about seauen thousand or eight hundred, and to
the number of fiftie were taken prisoners. And beside this, those Englishmen gained
eight&eacute;ene standards and one baner.</p>

<p>Incontinentlie the newes hereof were reported to the constable of France, who
was busie at the assault on the other side of the towne, whereof he was sore displeased,
and no lesse amazed; so that he caused the retreit to be sounded, for all the siege
on that side toward the poole was alreadie raised. After this, vpon counsell taken
amongst the Frenchmen, it was determined that they should dislodge: and so about
the middest of the next night, the constable and all the residue of his people departed
toward Fougiers, leauing behind them great plentie of artillerie both great and small,
with victuals, and all their other prouisions: as fourt&eacute;ene great guns and fortie barrels
of powder, thr&eacute;e hundred pipes of wine, two hundred pipes of bisket and flower,
two hundred frailes of figs and reisins, and fiue hundred barrels of herrings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissention betwixt the duke of Glocester and the bishop of Winchester.</div>

<p>Somewhat before this season fell a great diuision in the realme of England, which
of a sparkle was like to haue grown to a great flame. For whether the bishop of

or whether the duke disdained at the riches and pompous estate of the bishop: sure
it is that the whole realme was troubled with them and their partakers: so that the
citizens of London were faine to k&eacute;epe dailie and nightlie watches, and to shut vp
their shops for feare of that which was doubted to haue insued of their assembling of
people about them. The archbishop of Canturburie and the duke of Quimbre, called
the prince of Portingale, rode eight times in one daie betw&eacute;ene the two parties,
and so the matter was staied for a time. But the bishop of Winchester, to cl&eacute;ere

openlie rebuked the lords in generall, bicause that they in the time of warre, thorough
their priuie malice and inward grudge, had almost mooued the people to warre and
commotion, in which time all men ought or should be of one mind, hart, and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>sent:
requiring them to defend, serue, &amp; dread their souereigne lord king Henrie, in
performing his conquest in France, which was in manner brought to conclusion.
In this parlement the duke of Glocester laid certeine articles to the bishop of Winchester
his charge, the which with the answers hereafter doo insue; as followeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Articles set foorth by the duke of Glocester, against Henrie bishop of Winchester.</div>

<p>Here insueth the articles, as the kings councell hath concerned, the which the
high and mightie prince my lord of Glocester hath surmised vpon my lord of Winchester
chancellor of England, with the answer to the same.</p>

<p>1 First, whereas he being protectour, and defendour of this land, desired the
Tower to be opened to him, and to lodge him therein; Richard Wooduile esquier
(hauing at that time the charge of the k&eacute;eping of the Tower) refused his desire and
kept the same Tower against him vndulie and against reason, by the commandement
of my said lord of Winchester; and afterward in approouing of the said refusall, he
receiued the said Wooduile, and cherished him against the state and worship of the
king, and of my said lord of Glocester.</p>

<p>2 Item, my said lord of Winchester, without the aduise and assent of my said
lord of Glocester, or of the kings councell, purposed and disposed him to set hand
on the kings person, and to haue remooued him from Eltham, the place that he was
in, to Windsor, to the intent to put him in gouernance as him list.</p>

<p>3 Item, that were my said lord of Glocester (to whome of all persons that should
be in the land, by the waie of nature and birth, it belongeth to s&eacute;e the gouernance of
the kings person) informed of the said vndue purpose of my said lord of Winchester
declared in the article next abouesaid, and in letting thereof, determining to haue
gone to Eltham vnto the king to haue prouided as the cause required; my said lord
of Winchester vntrulie, and against the kings peace, to the intent to trouble my said
lord of Glocester going to the king, purposing his death, in case that he had gone
that waie, set men of armes and archers at the end of London bridge next Suthworke:
and in forebarring of the kings high waie, let draw the chaine of the stoupes there,
and set vp pipes and hurdles in manner and forme of bulworks: and set men in
chambers, cellars &amp; windowes, with bowes and arrowes and other weapons, to the
intent to bring finall destruction to my said lord of Glocesters person, as well as of
those that then should come with him.</p>

<p>4 Item, my said lord of Glocester saith and affirmeth, that our souereigne lord his
brother that was king Henrie the fift, told him on a time, when our souereigne lord
being prince was lodged in the palace of Westminster in the great chamber, by the
noise of a spaniell, there was on a night a man spied and taken behind a <a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>tapet of
the said chamber, the which man was deliuered to the earle of Arundell to be examined
vpon the cause of his being there at that time; the which so examined, at
that time confessed that he was there by the stirring and procuring of my said lord
of Winchester, ordeined to haue slaine the said prince therein his bed: wherefore
the said earle of Arundell let sacke him foorthwith, and drowned him in the Thames.</p>

<p>5 Item, our souereigne lord that was, king Henrie the fift, said vnto my said lord of
Glocester, that his father king Henrie the fourth liuing, and visited then greatlie
with sickenesse by the hand of God, my said lord of Winchester said vnto the king
(Henrie the fift then being prince) that the king his father so visited with sicknesse
was not personable, &amp; therfore not disposed to come in conuersation and gouernance
of the people; and for so much, counselled him to take the gouernance and crowne
of this land vpon him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="The_answer_of_the_bishop" id="The_answer_of_the_bishop">The answer of the bishop.</a></h2>


<p>Here insue the answers to the accusations made by my lord of Winchester chancellour
of England, vnto the causes and matters of heauinesse, declared in the articles
against him by my lord of Glocester.</p>

<p>1 First, as of the refusall made vnto my lord of Glocester, of opening the Tower
to him, of his lodging therein, by the commandement of my said lord of Winchester;
he answereth, that in the presence of my said lord of Glocester before his comming out
of his countrie of Heinault, for causes such as were thought resonable, it s&eacute;emeth
lawfull that the Tower should haue b&eacute;ene notablie stored and kept with vittels: howbeit
it was not foorthwith executed, and that in likewise after that my said lord of
Glocester, was gone into his said countrie of Heinault, for seditious and odious billes
and languages, cast and vsed in the citie of London, sounding of insurrection and rebellion
against the kings peace, and destruction aswell of diuerse estates of this land,
as strangers being vnder the defense, in so much that in doubt thereof, strangers in
great number fled the land. And for the more sure k&eacute;eping of the said Tower, Richard
Wooduile esquier so trusted with our souereigne lord the king that dead is (as well ye
know) &amp; also chamberlaine and councellor vnto my lord of Bedford, with a certeine
number of defensible persons assigned vnto him, was made deputie there by the assent
of the kings councell, being that time at London, for to abide therein, for the safegard
thereof; and streictlie charged by the said councell, that during that time of his
said charge, he should not suffer any man to be in the Tower stronger than himselfe,
without speciall charge or commandement of the king by the aduise of his councell.</p>

<p>2 Item, that soone after (vpon the comming of my said lord of Glocester into this
land from his countrie of Heinault) the said lords of the kings councell were informed,
that my said lord of Glocester grudged with the said maner of inforcing the Tower,
and let saie to them of London, that he had well vnderstand that they had b&eacute;ene
heauilie threatened for the time of his absence, and other wise than they should haue
b&eacute;ene, if he had b&eacute;ene in this land. Wherefore he was right euill contented, and
especiallie of the said forcing of the Tower, set vpon them in manner of a chased
villain, considering the good equitie and truth that they had alwaies kept vnto the
king, offering them there vpon remedie if they would.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frier Randolph.</div>

<p>3 Item, that after this, Richard Scot lieutenant of the Tower, by the commandement
of my said lord of Glocester, brought vnto him frier Randolph, the which had
long before confessed treason doone by him against the kings person that dead is, for
the which knowlege he was put to be kept in the said Tower, &amp; streictlie commanded
vnder great paine giuen vnto the said Scot, to k&eacute;epe him streictlie &amp; suerlie, &amp; not to
let him out of the said Tower without co&#x0304;mandment of the king by aduise of his councell.
The which frier Randolph, my said lord of Glocester kept then with himselfe
(not witting to the said Scot) as he declared to my said lord of Winchester, soone after
that he had brought the said frier Randolph to my lord of Glocester; saieng to my lord
of Winchester, that he was vndoone but he helped him, &amp; expressed, as for cause of
the withholding of frier Randolph: and saieng moreouer, that when he desired of my
said lord of Glocester, the deliuerance of the said frier Randolph, to lead him againe
vnto the Tower, or sufficient warrant for his discharge: my said lord of Glocester
answered him, that his commandement was sufficient warrant and discharge for him.
In the which thing abouesaid, it was thought to my lord of Winchester, that my
said lord of Glocester tooke vpon him further than his authoritie stretched vnto, and
caused him to doubt and dread, least that he would haue proc&eacute;eded further. And at
such time as the said Wooduile came vnto him, to aske his aduice and counsell, of
lodging my said lord of Glocester in the Tower; he aduised and charged him, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
before he suffered my said lord of Glocester, or any person to lodge therein stronger
than himselfe, he should purueie him a sufficient warrant therof, of the king, by the
aduise of his councell.</p>

<p>4 Item, as to the said article of the foresaid causes of heauinesse, my said lord
chancellor answereth, that he neuer purposed to set hand on the kings person, nor to
remoue him, or that he should be remoued, or put in any manner of gouernance, but
by the aduice of the kings councell. For he could not perceiue any manner of goodnesse
or of aduantage that might haue growne to him thereof, but rather great perill
and charge; and hereof my said lord of Winchester is readie to make proofe, in time
and place conuenient.</p>

<p>5 Item, as to the third article of the foresaid causes and heauines, my lord chancellor
answereth, that he was oft and diuerse times warned, by diuerse credible persons,
aswell at the time of the kings last parlement, holden at Westminster, as before and
since, that my said lord of Glocester purposed him bodilie harme, &amp; was warned therof
and counselled by the said persons, and that diuerse times, to absteine him from comming
to Westminster as my said lord of Winchester declared vnto my said lord of Glocester.</p>

<p>6 Item, that in the time of the said parlement, diuerse persons of low estate of the
citie of London, in great number assembled on a day vpon the wharfe, at the crane of
the vinetr&eacute;e, and wished and desired that they had there the person of my lord of
Winchester, saieng that they would haue throwen him into the Thames, to haue taught
him to swim with wings. Whereof billes and language of slander and threatnings
were cast and spoken in the said citie by my said lord the chancellor, which caused
him to suppose that they that so said and did, willed and desired his destruction,
although they had no cause.</p>

<p>7 Item, that after the comming to London of sir Rafe Botiller, and maister Lewes,
sent from my lord of Bedford, to the rest of the lords of the councell, they being
informed, that my said lord of Glocester did beare displeasure to my said lord of
Winchester, they came to the said lord of Glocester to his In, the second sundaie
next before All hallondaie, and there opened vnto him, that they had knowledge and
vnderstanding of the said displeasure, praieng him to let them know if he bare such
displeasure against my said lord of Winchester, and also the causes thereof. At the
which time (as my said lord of Winchester was afterwards informed) my said lord of
Glocester affirmed that he was heauie toward him, and not without causes that peraduenture
he would put in writing.</p>

<p>8 Item, that after the mondaie next before Allhallondaie last past in the night,
the people of the said citie of London, by the commandement of my said lord of
Glocester, as it was said (for what cause my lord the chancellor wist not) assembled
in the citie, armed and arraied, and so continued all the night. Amongst diuerse of
the which (the same night by what excitation, my said lord the chancellor wist not)
seditious and heauie language was vsed, and in especiall against the person of my
lord the chancellor. And so the same mondaie at night, my said lord of Glocester
sent vnto the Ins of court at London, charging them of the court dwelling in the
same, to be with him vpon the morrow at eight of the clocke in their best arraie.</p>

<p>9 Item, that on the morrow being tuesdaie next following, my said lord of Glocester
sent earlie vnto the maior and aldermen of the said citie of London, to ordeine
him to the number of thr&eacute;e hundred persons on horsse backe, to accompanie him vnto
such a place as he disposed him to ride, which (as it was said) was vnto the king, to
the intent to haue his person, and to remoue him from the place that he was in, without
assent or aduise of the kings councell. The which thing was thought vnto my said
lord the chancellor, that he ought in no wise to haue doone, nor had not b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene
so before.</p>

<p>10 Item, that my said lord the chancellor, considering the things aboue said, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
doubting therefore of perils that might haue insued thereof, intending to purueie
there against, and namelie for his owne suertie and defense, according to the law of
nature, ordeined to let, that no force of people should come on the bridge of London
towards him, by the which he or his might haue b&eacute;ene indangered or noied, not intending
in any wise bodilie harme vnto my said lord of Glocester, nor to any other
person, but onelie his owne defense, in eschewing the perill abouesaid.</p>

<p>11 Item, as toward the fourth and fift of the said articles, my lord the chancellor
answereth, that he was euer true to all those that were his souereigne lords and reigned
vpon him, and that he neuer purposed treason or vntruth against any of their persons,
and in especiall against the person of our said souereigne lord Henrie the fift. The
which considering the great wisdome, truth, and manhood that all men knew in him,
he would not for the time that he was king, haue set on my said lord the chancellor
so great trust as he did, if he had found or thought in him such vntruth. The which
thing my said lord the chancellor offered to declare and shew, as it belongeth to a
man of his estate to doo, requiring therevpon my lord of Bedford and all the lords
spirituall and temporall in this parlement, that it might be s&eacute;ene that there were
iudges conuenient in this case, that they would doo him right, or else that he might
haue leaue of the king by their aduise to go sue his right, before him that ought to
be his iudge.</p>

<p>12 And as toward the letter sent by my lord of Winchester vnto my lord of Bedford,
of the which the tenor is before rehearsed, of the which my lord of Glocester
complained him of the malicious and vntrue purpose of my said lord of Winchester,
as toward the assembling of the people, and gathering of a field in the kings land,
in troubling thereof, and against the kings peace: my said lord of Winchester answereth,
that if his said letters duelie vnderstand, and in such wise as he vnderstood and
meant in the writing of them, it maie not reasonable be gathered and taken, that my
said lord of Winchester intended to gather any field, or assemble people in troubling
of the kings land, and against the kings peace, but rather purposed to acquite him to
the king in his truth, and to k&eacute;epe the rest and peace in the kings land, and to eschew
rebellion, disobedience and all trouble. For by that that in the beginning of the said
letter, he calleth my said lord of Bedford his lieuest lord after one, that is the king,
whome he ought to accept of dutie of his truth, the which he hath euer kept, and will
k&eacute;epe.</p>

<p>13 Moreouer, in the said letter he desireth the comming home of my lord of Bedford,
for the welfare of the king and of his realmes of England and of France, which
stand principallie in k&eacute;eping of his rest and peace, and praieth my said lord of Bedford
to sp&eacute;ed his co&#x0304;ming into England, in eschewing of ieopardie of the land, and of
a field, which he dread him might haue followed if he had long taried. As toward
those words; "If ye tarie, we shall put this land in aduenture with a field, such a
brother ye haue here, &amp;c." My said lord of Winchester saith, the sooth is: before or
he wrote the said letter, by the occasion of certeine ordinances made by the maior and
aldermen of London against the excessiue taking of masons, carpentars, tilers, plasterers,
and other labourers for their dailie iournies, and approued by the kings deuise
and councell, there were cast manie heauinesses and seditious billes vnder the names
of such labourers, threatning rising with manie thousands, and menacing of estates of
the land, and likewise seditious and euill language sowen and so continued and
likelie to haue insued, of purpose and intent of disobedience and rebellion. To the redressing
of which, it s&eacute;emed to my lord the chancellor, that my said lord of Glocester
did not his indeuour diligence that he might haue shewed. For lacke of
which diligence, they that were disposed to doo disobeisance were incouraged &amp; imboldned,
so that it was like, that they should haue made a gathering, and that the
king and his true subiects should haue b&eacute;ene compelled to haue made a field to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
haue withstand them; the which field making, had b&eacute;ene aduenturing of this land,
and in tokening that it was neuer my said lord chancellors intent, to gather no
field, but as truth most stirred him against such as riotouslie would make such assemblie
against our souereigne lord, and the weale of this land, he desired so hastilie
the comming of my said lord of Bedford: the which he would in no wise haue so
greatlie desired, if he would haue purposed him vnto any vnlawful making of a field;
for he wist well, that my said lord of Bedford would most sharplie haue chastised
and punished all those, that so would make any riotous assemblie.</p>

<p>A decr&eacute;e or order taken by the kings councell for the pacifieng of the quarels and
variances that were betw&eacute;ene the duke of Glocester, and the bishop of Winchester.</p></div>

<p>The causes aforesaid and quarels by vs s&eacute;ene, heard, and diligentlie examined
and decr&eacute;ed, by the assent of the said parties, ordeine and award, that my lords of
Glocester and of Winchester, for any thing doone or spoken, by that one partie
against that other, or by anie of theirs, or anie other person or persons, afore the
seuenth daie of this present moneth of March, neuer hereafter take causes, quarels,

And that my said lord of Glocester be good lord to my said lord of Winchester, &amp;
haue him in loue and affection as his kinsman &amp; vncle. And that my said lord of
Winchester haue to my said lord of Glocester true and sad loue and affection, doo
and be readie to doo him such seruice as apperteineth of honestie to my said lord

all those adherents, counsellers, and fauourers of that other, and shew them at all
times fauourable loue and affection, as for anie thing by them doone or said, before
the seauenth daie of March.</p>

<p>And we decr&eacute;e, ordeine, and award, that my said lord of Winchester, in the presence
of the king our souereigne lord, my lord of Bedford, and my lord of Glocester,
and the residue of the lords spirituall and temporall, and commons being in this
this present parlement, saie and declare in maner and forme that followeth: My
souereigne lord, I haue well vnderstand, that I am noised among the states of your
land, how that the king our souereigne lord that was, at that time being prince,
and lodged in the great chamber at Westminster, by the baieng of a spaniell, there
was on a night taken behind a <a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>tapet in the same chamber, a man, that should haue
confessed, that he was there by mine excitation and procuring, to haue slaine the

<p>Furthermore, I am accused, how that I should haue stirred the king that last died,
the time also that he was prince, to haue taken the gouernance of this realme, and
the crowne vpon him, his father liuing the same time, being king. Through which
language and noising, I f&eacute;ele my name and fame greatlie enblemished in diuerse mens
opinions. Wherevpon, I take first God to my witnes, and after all the world, that I
haue b&eacute;ene at all times, and am true louer, and true man, to you my souereigne lord,
and shall be all my life. And also, I haue b&eacute;ene to my souereigne lord that was your
father, all the time of his reigne, true man, and for such he tooke me, trusted me
and cherished me to his liues end; and as I trust, no man will affirme the contrarie,
nor neuer in my life procuring nor imagining death nor destruction of his person, ne
assenting to any such thing, or like thereto, the time that he was king or prince, or
else in other state.</p>

<p>I was likewise true man to king Henrie the fourth; all the time that he was my
souereigne lord, and reigned vpon me. In which matters, in all maner of wise that
it liketh to you my souereigne lord for to command me, I am readie for to declare me:
and furthermore, where, how, and when it shall like you, by the aduise of your
councell, to assigne me. Wherefore I bes&eacute;ech you my souereigne lord, as humblie
as I can, considering that there is no grounded processe, by the which I might lawfullie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in these matters abouesaid, be conuict (blessed be God) to hold me, and declare
me, by the aduise of all the lords, spirituall and temporall, being in this present
parlement, true man to you my souereigne lord, and so to haue b&eacute;ene vnto my souereigne
lords that were your father and grandfather, and true man also to haue b&eacute;ene
at all times to your said father whilest he was prince, or else in anie other estate, the
said slander and noise notwithstanding, and this same declaration to be inacted in this
your said present parlement.</p>

<p>The which words declared in maner as it is abouesaid, it s&eacute;emeth to my said lords
the arbitrators, that it is m&eacute;et, that my said lord of Winchester draw him apart, and
in the meane time, the lords being present, be singularlie examined therevpon, and
saie their aduise. And if it be assented by them, in maner as my said lord of Winchester
desireth, let him be called againe, and that then my lord of Bedford haue these
words in effect that follow: Faire vncle, the king my lord by the aduise of his councell,
hath commanded me to saie to you, that he hath well vnderstand and considered
all the matters which y&eacute;e haue h&eacute;ere openlie declared in his presence, and therevpon
y&eacute;e desire a petition, that he will declare you, and by the aduise and assent of the
lords spirituall and temporall, being in this present parlement, he declareth you a true
man to him, and that y&eacute;e haue so b&eacute;ene to my lord his father, and grandfather, also
true man to my lord his father while he was prince, or else in anie other estate, the
said dislander and noising notwithstanding, and will that the said declaration be so
inacted in this present parlement.</p>

<p>After the which words thus said (as before is declared) it was decr&eacute;ed also by the
said lords arbitrators, that the said lord of Winchester should haue these words that
follow vnto my said lord of Glocester: My lord of Glocester, I haue conceiued to my
great heauinesse, that y&eacute;e should haue receiued by diuerse reports, that I should
haue purposed and imagined against your person, honor, and estate, in diuerse maners,
for the which, y&eacute;e haue taken against me great displeasure: Sir, I take God to
my witnesse, that what reports so euer haue b&eacute;ene to you of me, peraduenture of
such as haue had no great affection to me, God forgiue it them, I neuer imagined, ne
purposed anie thing that might be hindering or preiudice to your person, honor, or
estate: and therefore I praie you, that y&eacute;e be vnto me good lord from this time
foorth; for by my will, I gaue neuer other occasion, nor purpose not to doo hereafter
by the grace of God. The which words so by him said, it was decr&eacute;ed by the same
arbitrators, that my lord of Glocester, should answer and saie: Faire vncle, sith y&eacute;e
declare you such a man, as y&eacute;e saie, I am right glad that it is so, and for such a man
I take you. And when this was doone, it was decr&eacute;ed by the same arbitrators, that
euerie each of my lord of Glocester, and Winchester, should take either other by the
hand, in the presence of the king and all the parlement, in signe and token of good
loue &amp; accord, the which was doone, and the parlement adiorned till after Easter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this reconciliation, such as loued peace reioised (sith it is a fowle &amp; pernicious
thing for priuat men, much more for noblemen to be at variance, sith vpon them depend
manie in affections diuerse, whereby factions might grow to the shedding of
bloud) though others, to whom contention &amp; hartgrudge is delight, wished to s&eacute;e the
vttermost misch&eacute;efe that might therof insue, which is the vtter ouerthrow and desolation
of populous tribes, euen as with a litle sparkle whole houses are manie times consumed
to ashes; as the old prouerbe saith, and that verie well and aptlie;</p>

<p>But when the great fier of this dissention, betw&eacute;ene these two noble personages,
was thus by the arbitrators (to their knowledge and iudgement) vtterlie quenched
out, and laid vnder boord; all other controuersies betw&eacute;ene other lords, taking part
with the one partie or the other, were appeased, and brought to concord, so that for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
ioy the king caused a solemne fest to be kept on Whitsundaie; on which daie he
created Richard Plantagenet, sonne and heire to the erle of Cambridge, (whome his
father at Southampton had put to death, as before y&eacute;e haue heard) duke of Yorke,
not fores&eacute;eing that this preferment should be his destruction, nor that his s&eacute;ed should
of his generation be the extreame end and finall conclusion. He the same daie also
promoted Iohn lord Mowbraie, and earle marshall, sonne and heire to Thomas duke
of Norffolke (by king Richard the second exiled this realme) to the title, name, and
stile of duke of Norffolke.</p>

<p>During this feast, the duke of Bedford adorned the king with the high order of
knighthood, who on the same daie dubbed with the sword these knights, whose
names insue: Richard duke of Yorke, Iohn duke of Norffolke; the earle of Westmerland,
Henrie lord Persie, Iohn lord Butler, sonne to the earle of Ormond, the
lord Rosse, the lord Matrauers, the lord Welles, the lord Barkelie; sir Iames Butler,
sir Henrie Greie of Tankaruile, sir Iohn Talbot, sir Rafe Greie of Warke, sir Robert
V&eacute;ere, sir Richard Greie, sir Edmund Hungerford, sir Walter Wingfield, sir Iohn

sir Edmund Trafford, sir Iohn Iune ch&eacute;efe baron, and diuerse others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Excester dieth.</div>

<p>After this solemne feast ended, a great aid and subsidie was granted for the continuance
of the conquest in France, and so therevpon monie was gathered, and men
were prepared in euerie citie, towne, and countrie. During which businesse, Thomas
duke of Excester, great vncle to the king, a right sage and discr&eacute;et councellor, departed
out of this mortall life, at his manor of Gr&eacute;enewich, and with all funerall
pompe was conueied through London to Berrie, and there buried. &para; In the same
yeare also died the ladie Elizabeth, halfe sister to the same duke, and of the whole

<p>[Philip Morgan after the death of Iohn Fortham (sometime treasuror of England,
bishop of Elie and Durham, both which bishopriks, for anie thing that I can yet s&eacute;e,
he inioied both at one time) was made bishop of Elie in the yeare of our redemption
1425, in this sort. Henrie the sixt and manie of the nobilitie had written to the conuent
of the church of Elie, to choose William Alnewicke (doctor of both lawes confessor
to the king and k&eacute;eper of the priuie seale) to be their bishop. Notwithstanding
which (they hauing more regard to their owne priuileges and benefit) chose Peter
the prior of Elie to succ&eacute;ed in the place of Iohn Fortham. But none of both these
inioied that roome; for Martin bishop of Rome (stepping into the matter to make
the third part, neither fauouring the kings motion nor approouing the monks election)
remooued this William Morgan from the s&eacute;e of Worcester vnto Elie, sometime
called Helix: as I haue s&eacute;ene it set downe in Saxon characters in an ancient booke of
the liues of saints written in the Saxon toong, about the yeare of Christ 1010, before
the time of Edward the confessor, and much about the time of Albo Floriacensis.
This Morgan sat at Elie nine yeares, twentie and six w&eacute;eks, and foure daies,
departing this life in his manour of Hatfield, in the yeare 1434, and was buried at
the Charterhouse of London; being the twentie and fourth bishop that was installed
in that place.]</p>

<p>While these things were thus a dooing in England, the earle of Warwike, lieutenant
for the regent in France, entered into the countrie of Maine, &amp; besieged the
towne of Chateau de loire, the which shortlie to him was rendered, whereof he made
capteine Matthew <a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>Gough, esquier. After this, he tooke by assault the castell of

the castell of Lude, and made there capteine William Gladesdale gentleman.
Here he was informed, that the Frenchmen were assembled in the countrie of Beausse,
wherevpon he hasted thitherwards to haue giuen them battell, but they hauing knowledge
of his approch, durst not abide to trie the matter with him by a pight field, but
fled before he came n&eacute;ere them.</p>

left the valiant lord Willoughbie, and then returned to Paris. During which season,
he was ordeined by the thr&eacute;e estates of the realme of England, to be gouernour of
the yoong king in the place of the duke of Excester deceassed; howbeit, he did not
as yet returne into England, but remained in France for a season, and atchiued manie
worthie enterprises. Whilest the lord regent of France was thus in England, meanes
was made by the duke of Burgognie, for the deliuerie of the duke of Alanson, taken
at the battell of Vernoile, and now for the summe of two hundred thousand crownes
he was set at libertie; but he would not by anie meanes acknowlege the king of

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<p>After that the duke of Bedford had set all things in good order in England, he
tooke leaue of the king, and togither with his wife returned into France, first landing
at Calis, where the bishop of Winchester (that also passed the seas with him)
receiued the habit, hat, and dignitie of a cardinall, with all ceremonies to it apperteining:
which promotion, the late K. right d&eacute;eplie persing into the vnrestrainable
ambitious mind of the man, that euen from his youth was euer to checke at the
highest; and also right well ascerteined with what intollerable pride his head should
soone be swollen vnder such a hat: did therefore all his life long k&eacute;epe this prelat
backe from that presumptuous estate. But now the king being yoong and the regent
his fr&eacute;end, he obteined his purpose, to his great profit, and the impouerishing of the
spiritualtie of this realme. For by a bull legantin, which he purchased from Rome,
he gathered so much treasure, that no man in maner had monie but he: so that he
was called the rich cardinall of Winchester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord of Rustinian taken and his people slaine and discomfited.</div>

<p>After that the lord regent was arriued in France, the lord of Rustinian, marshall
of Britaine, assembled a great companie of the British nation, which fortified and repared
the towne of Pontorson: and after the said marshall, with a thousand men, entered
into the countrie of Constantine, and comming before the towne of Auranches,
was incountered by the Englishmen of that garrison; &amp; after long fight, his people
were put to the worse, chased, and discomfited, and he himselfe taken prisoner in the
field. The duke of Bedford, hearing that the towne of Pontorson, situate within
leagues of Mont Saint Michaell, was newlie fortified, and stronglie defended, sent
thither the earle of Warwike, accompanied with the lord Scales, and other valiant
capteins and souldiers, to the number of seauen thousand men, to besiege the towne;
who so inuironed it on euerie side, that no man could steale neither in nor out.</p>

<p>The siege thus long continuing, vittels began to wax scant in the English armie:
wherefore the lord Scales, hauing in his companie sir Iohn Harpeleie bailiffe of Constantine,
sir William Brearton bailiffe of Caen, sir Rafe Tesson, sir Iohn Carbonell,
and thr&eacute;e thousand good men of warre, departed from the siege to get vittels, powder,
and other things necessarie for their purpose. And as they were returning with their
cariages by the sea coast, n&eacute;ere to Saint Michaels Mount, they suddenlie were incountered
by their enimies, whereof were ch&eacute;efe, the baron of Coloses, the lord Dausebost,
capteine of the said Mount, the lord Mountabon, the lord Montburchier, the
lord of Chateaugiron, the lord of Tintignat, the lord of Chateaubrian, with six
thousand men of warre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the cene thursdaie.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Enguerant.</i></div>

<p>The lord Scales and his companie, perceiuing themselues beset on the one side with
the sea, &amp; on the other with their enimies, alighted from their horsses, and like couragious
persons, there in an vnspeakeable furie, set on their enimies. The fight was
fierce &amp; cruell. The Englishmen kept themselues close togither; so that their enimies
could get no aduantage of them. At the last, the lord Scales cried S. George they
fl&eacute;e. Wherevpon, the Englishmen tooke such courage, and the Frenchmen that
fought before, were so dismaied, that they began to fl&eacute;e in d&eacute;ed. The Englishmen
leaped on horssebacke, and followed them so, that they slue and tooke aboue eleuen
hundred persons, among the which were taken the baron of Coloses, the vicount of
Rone, and others. The lord of Chateaugiron, with a Scotish capteine, &amp; diuerse
other men of name were slaine. After this victorie, the lord Scales with his vittels,
prouision, and prisoners, returned to the siege, where he was of the earle and other
noble men ioiouslie receiued.</p>

<p>Whilest the siege continued thus before Pontorson, Christopher Hanson, and other
souldiers of the garrison of Saint Susan, made a rode into the countrie of Aniou, and
came to a castell called Ramfort, which castell was so priuilie scaled, that the capteine
within, and his companie, were taken or slaine, before they knew of their enimies
approching. When knowledge hereof was giuen vnto the Frenchmen which
were assembled, to the number of twentie thousand, to raise the siege that laie before
Pontorson, they left that enterprise, and went to recouer the said castell of Ramfort,
and so comming before it, planted their siege so on ech side of it, that at length by
composition the Englishmen within, doubting to be taken by force, rendered vp the
castell, hauing libertie to depart with bag and baggage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pontorson rendered to the Englishmen.</div>

<p>Shortlie after, the lord of Raix, calling himselfe lieutenant generall for the Dolphin,
entred into Maine with an armie of thr&eacute;e thousand men, and by force tooke the
castell of Malicorne, wherof was capteine an Englishman, one Oliuer Osbatersbie.
In like maner, they tooke the little castell of Lude, and therein William Blackborne,
lieutenant for William Glasdale esquier. After this, the Frenchmen returned backe
to the Dolphin, and kept not on their iourneie to Pontorson, for that they vnderstood
by espials, that the earle of Warwike, and the Englishmen there, determined to giue
them battell, if they once attempted to raise the siege. They within the towne,
being streictlie besieged, perceiuing no likelihood of succours, and s&eacute;eing the English
armie dailie increase, fell to treatie for doubt to be taken by force, and so rendered
the towne vpon condition, that they might depart with horsse and harnesse onelie.
Which being granted to them, the erle like a valiant capteine entred into the towne,
and there appointed for gouernors, the lord Ros, and the lord Talbot, and leauing
there a conuenient garrison, returned to the lord regent.</p>

<p>After the taking of this towne of Pontorson, there was a league and treatie concluded
betw&eacute;ene the regent and the duke of Britaine; by the articles of which agr&eacute;ement,
the townes of Pontorson and saint Iames de Beuuron were beaten downe to the ground
and raced. When the lord of Raix was departed out of Maine (as ye haue heard)
Christopher Hanson, Philip <a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>Gough, Martin Godfrie, called the Scaler, tooke by
stealth the castell of saint Laurence de Mortiers. At the same time, when the capteine
and the most part of his companie were gone foorth to heare masse, in a church
ouer against the same castell, and k&eacute;eping themselues close, till the capteine returned,
they tooke him as he was entered within the first gate, &amp; so was this castell stuffed
with Englishmen, and capteine thereof was appointed sir William Oldhall.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Or rather Goche.</p></div>

<p>The same season, sir Iohn Fastolfe, gouernour of the countries of Aniou and Maine,
assembled a great puissance of men of warre, and laid siege before the castell of saint
Owen Distais, beside the towne of Lauall; and after he had laine there ten daies,
the castell was deliuered, they within departing with their liues and armour onelie to
them granted, by the tenor of the composition, which they tooke with the same sir
Iohn Fastolfe. After the winning of this castell, the Englishmen remooued to the
strong castell of Grauile, and after twelue daies, they within offered to y&eacute;eld the
castell by a daie, if they were not succoured by the Dolphin or his power: the offer
was taken and pledges deliuered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Hostages executed for promise broken.</div>

<p>Then sir Iohn Fastolfe returned in post to the regent, aduertising him of this composition
and agr&eacute;ement; wherefore, the said regent raised a great power to fight with
the Frenchmen at the daie appointed, and in his companie were the earles of Mortaigne
and Warwike, the lord Ros and Talbot, sir Iohn Fastolfe, sir Iohn Aubemond, sir
Iohn Ratcliffe, and diuerse other, to the number of twentie thousand men; and so
marched forwards, in hope to m&eacute;et and ioine battell with their aduersaries. But the
French power, being not far off from the place, durst not approch. Wherefore, the
regent sent to sir Iohn Fastolfe incontinentlie, to receiue the castell; but they within
(contrarie to promise and appointment) had newlie vitteled &amp; manned the place, and
so forsaking the pledges, and their fellowes in armes, refused to render the fortresse;
wherefore, the pledges were brought before their sight, and there before the castell
openlie put to death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Talbot, a valient capteine.</div>

<p>After this the lord Talbot was made gouernour of Aniou and Maine, and sir Iohn
Fastolfe was assigned to an other place, which lord Talbot, being both of noble birth,
and of haultie courage, after his comming into France, obteined so manie glorious
victories of his enimies, that his onelie name was &amp; yet is dreadfull to the French
nation, and much renowmed amongst all other people. This lustie and most valiant
capteine entered into Maine, where he slue men, destroied castels, burnt townes, and
in conclusion suddenlie tooke the towne of Lauall. The lord Loehac, and diuerse
other, withdrew into the castell, in the which they were so streictlie besieged, that
in the end they agr&eacute;ed to paie the lord Talbot an hundred thousand crownes, for
licence to depart, with all their bag and baggage.</p>

<p>Then was this castell deliuered to the k&eacute;eping of Gilbert Halsall, which after was
slaine at the siege of Orleance, in whose place Matthew <a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>Gough was made capteine
there: who being at the iournie of Senlis, by treason of a miller that kept a mill
adioining to the wall, the Frenchmen entered into the towne, and brought it againe into
their subiection. Now the duke of Bedford hearing that the towne of Montargis,
in the territorie of Orleance, was but slenderlie kept, and not thoroughlie furnished,
sent the erle of Suffolke, with his brother sir Iohn Poole, and sir Henrie Bisset, hauing
in their companie a six thousand men, to assalt that towne; but when they came
thither and found the towne both well manned and stronglie fortified, contrarie to
their expectation, they surceassed from giuing the assault, and onelie laid their siege
round about it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Or rather Goche.</p></div>

<p>The earle of Warwike was appointed to lie with a great number of men of warre, at
S. Mathelines de Archempe, to incounter the Frenchmen, if they would attempt to
aid or vittell those within the towne. The situation of this towne was such, that by
reason of waters and marishes, the English armie must n&eacute;eds seuer it selfe into thr&eacute;e
parts, so that the one could not easilie helpe the other, but either by boats or bridges.
This siege continued aboue two moneths, so that in the meane time the Frenchmen
had leasure to prouide for the succour thereof; and so it came to passe, that the constable
of France Arthur of Britaine, the lord Boisac one of the marshals, Stephan la
Hire, Pothon de Saintreiles, the lord Grauile, and diuerse others, to the number of
thr&eacute;e thousand horssemen, were sent foorth by the Dolphin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A great slaughter by negligence of the watch at Montargis.</div>

<p>These priuilie in the night season came on that side, where sir Iohn de la Poole and
sir Henrie Bisset laie, whome they found so out of order, and without good watch,
that the Frenchmen entered into their lodgings, slue manie in their beds, and spared
none, for their resistance was but small. Sir Iohn de la Poole with his horsse saued himselfe,
and sir Henrie Bisset escaped by a boat, and eight other with him. The residue
fl&eacute;eing in plumpes, and striuing to passe by a bridge of timber, the which was
pestered with preasse of the multitude, brake, and so there were a great number
drowned: insomuch that there were slaine by the enimies swoord, and drowned in
the water, fift&eacute;ene hundred men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Sir Nicholas Burdet.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Polydor.</i></div>

<p>The earle of Warwike hearing of this misfortune, departed from saint Mathelines
with all sp&eacute;ed, and comming before Montargis, offered battell to the French capteins,
which answered, that they had manned and vittelled the towne, and intended
to doo no more at that time. The Englishmen h&eacute;erevpon came softlie backe againe
with all their ordinance to the duke of Bedford. Yet had not the French so great
cause to vaunt of their successe: for at this verie time, sir Nicholas Burdet, appointed
by the duke of Summerset to indamage his enimies in the coasts of Britaine,
sent horssemen into euerie part, woorking all the displeasure to the people that might
be deuised. The countrie, through which he passed, was wasted, the townes were
burnt, the houses spoiled, and great number of prisoners taken, the small villages
were destroied, and the walled townes ransomed, and so without hurt or damage
the said sir Nicholas Burdet returned into Normandie.</p>

<p>These newes being signified to the constable, and other the French capteins, asswaged
their great mirth and triumphant ioy, concerned for the victorie of Montargis, that
loth they were to attempt anie further enterprises against the English nation. But
the duke of Alanson, who (as ye haue heard) was latelie deliuered out of captiuitie,
reuiued againe the dulled spirits of the Dolphin, and somewhat aduanced, in hope
of good sp&eacute;ed, the fainting harts of his capteins; so that (some occasion offered)
they determined to atchiue a notable feat (as they tooke it) against the Englishmen,
which was the recouerie of the city of Mans out of their hands: for so it happened,
that diuers of the ch&eacute;efe rulers in that citie, and namelie diuerse spirituall persons,
meaning to reuolt to the Dolphins side, aduertised him by letters of their whole
minds, which letters were conueied vnto him by certeine friers.</p>

<p>The Dolphin glad of those newes, appointed the lords de la Breth and Faiet, marshals
of France, accompanied with the lords of Mount Iehan, of Buell, Doruall,
Torsie, Beaumanor, the Hire, and his brother Guilliam, with fiue hundred other valiant
capteins and souldiers, to the accomplishing of this enterprise; who comming
thither at the daie assigned, in the night season approched towards the walles, making
a little fire on an hill, in sight of the towne, to signifie their comming, which perceiued
by the citizens that n&eacute;ere to the great church were watching for the same, a
burning cresset was shewed out of the st&eacute;eple, which suddenlie was put out and
quenched. What n&eacute;edeth manie words?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mans lost by treason of the citizens.</div>

<p>The capteins on horsseback came to the gate, the traitors within slue the porters
and watchmen, and let in their fr&eacute;ends, whereby the footmen entered first, and the
men of armes waited at the barriers, to the intent that if n&eacute;ed required, they might
fight it out in open field. Hereby manie Englishmen were slaine, and a great crie
and garboile raised through the towne, as in such surprises is woont. The cause of this
misch&eacute;efe was not knowen to any, but onelie to the conspirators; for the remnant of
the citizens being no partakers, imagined, that the Englishmen had made hauocke
in the towne, and put all to the sword. The Englishmen on the other side iudged,
that the citizens had begun some new rebellion against them, or else had striuen
amongst themselues.</p>

<p>The earle of Suffolke, which was gouernour of the towne, hauing perfect knowledge
by such as scaped from the wals, how the matter went, withdrew without any
tarriance into the castell, which standeth at the gate of saint Vincent, whereof was
constable Thomas Gower esquier, whither also fled manie Englishmen; so as for
vrging the enimie, prease of the number, and lacke of vittels, they could not haue
indured long; wherefore they priuilie sent a messenger to the lord Talbot, which then
laie at Alanson, certifieng him in how hard a case they were. The lord Talbot hearing
these newes, like a carefull capteine in all hast assembled togither about seuen
hundred men, &amp; in the euening departed from Alanson, so as in the morning he came
to a castell called Guierch, two miles from Mans, and there staied a while, till he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
sent out Matthew <a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>Gough, as an espiall, to vnderstand how the Frenchmen demeaned

into the castell, where he learned that the Frenchmen verie negligentlie vsed themselues,
without taking h&eacute;ed to their watch, as though they had b&eacute;ene out of all danger:
which well vnderstood, he returned againe, and within a mile of the citie met
the lord Talbot, and the lord Scales, and opened vnto them all things, according to
his credence. The lords then, to make hast in the matter, bicause the daie approched,
with all sp&eacute;ed possible came to the posterne gate, and alighting from their horsses,
about six of the clocke in the morning, they issued out of the castell, crieng, saint

<p>The Frenchmen being thus suddenlie taken, were sore amazed, in so much that
some of them, being not out of their beds, got vp in their shirts, and lept ouer the
walles. Other ran naked out of the gates to saue their liues, leauing all their apparell,
horsses, armour, and riches behind them, none was hurt but such as resisted.
&para; Hard shift was made on all hands for safetie of life, and happie was he that could
find a place of refuge where to lurke vnspide and vnhurt of the enimie; who in the
execution of their vengeance were so peremptorie, that it was a matter of great difficultie
or rather impossibilitie to escape their force. To be short, there were slaine
and taken, to the number of foure hundred gentlemen, the priuat souldiers were
frankelie let go. After this, inquisition was made of the authors of the treason, and
there were found &amp; condemned thirtie citizens, twentie priests, and fift&eacute;ene friers,
who according to their demerits were all hanged.</p>

<p>The citie of Mans being thus recouered, the lord Talbot returned to Alanson, and
shortlie after the earle of Warwike departed into England, to be gouernour of the yoong
king, in st&eacute;ed of Thomas duke of Excester, latelie departed to God, and then was
the lord Thomas Montacute earle of Salisburie sent into France, to supplie the roome
of the said earle of Warwike, who landed at Calis with fiue thousand men, and so
came to the duke of Bedford as then lieng in Paris, where they fell in councell togither
concerning the affaires of France, and namelie the earle of Salisburie began maruellouslie
to phantasie the gaining of the citie &amp; countrie of Orleance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Montacute earle of Salisburie a politike and valiant man.</div>

<p>This earle was the man at that time, by whose wit, strength, and policie, the English
name was much fearefull and terrible to the French nation, which of himselfe
might both appoint, command, and doo all things in manner at his pleasure, in
whose power (as it appeared after his death) a great part of the conquest consisted:
for suerlie, he was a man both painefull, diligent, and readie to withstand all dangerous
chances that were at hand, prompt in counsell, and of courage inuincible, so
that in no one man, men put more trust; nor any singular person wan the harts so
much of all men.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Les grandes chroniques de Britagne.</i></div>

<p>Herevpon, after this great enterprise had long b&eacute;ene debated in the priuie councell,
the earle of Salisburies deuise therein was of them all granted and allowed, so that he
being replenished with good hope of victorie, and furnished with artillerie &amp; munition
apperteining to so great an enterprise, accompanied with the earle of Suffolke, and the
lord Talbot, and with a valiant armie, to the number of ten thousand men, departed
from Paris, and passed through the countrie of Beausse. There he tooke by assault
the towne of Genuille, and within fiue daies after had the castell deliuered vnto him,
by them that were fled into it for their safegard. He also tooke the towne of Baugencie,
suffering euerie man which would become subiect to the king of England, to
inioie their lands and goods. The townes of Meun vpon Loire, and Iargeaulx, hearing
of these dooings, presented to them the keies of their townes vpon like agr&eacute;ement.

<div class="sidenote">Orleance besieged.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bastard of Orleance.</div>

<p>After this, in the moneth of September the earle came before the citie of Orleance,
and planted his siege on the one side of the riuer of Loire; but before his comming,
the bastard of Orleance, the bishop of the citie, and a great number of Scots, hearing
of the earles intent, made diuerse fortifications about the towne, and destroied the
suburbes, in which were twelue parish churches, and foure orders of friers. They
cut also downe all the vines, tr&eacute;es, and bushes, within fiue leagues of the citie, so
that the Englishmen should haue neither refuge nor succour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A bulwarke at Orleance taken.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl.</i></div>

<p>After the siege had continued full thr&eacute;e w&eacute;ekes, the bastard of Orleance issued out
of the gate of the bridge, and fought with the Englishmen; but they receiued him
with so fierce and terrible strokes, that he was with all his companie compelled to retire
and fl&eacute;e backe into the citie. But the Englishmen followed so fast, in killing and
taking of their enimies, that they entered with them. &para; The bulworke of the bridge,
with a great tower standing at the end of the same, was taken incontinentlie by the
Englishmen, who behaued themselues right valiantlie vnder the conduct of their
couragious capteine, as at this assault, so in diuerse skirmishes against the French;
partlie to k&eacute;epe possession of that which Henrie the fift had by his magnanimitie &amp;
puissance atchiued, as also to inlarge the same. But all helped not. For who can
hold that which will awaie: In so much that some cities by fraudulent practises,
othersome by martiall prowesse were recouered by the French, to the great discouragement
of the English and the appalling of their spirits; whose hope was now
dashed partlie by their great losses and discomfitures (as after you shall heare) but
ch&eacute;eflie by the death of the late deceassed Henrie their victorious king; as Chr.

</div></div>

<p>In this conflict, manie Frenchmen were taken, but more were slaine, and the
k&eacute;eping of the tower and bulworke was committed to William Glasdale esquier. By
the taking of this bridge the passage was stopped, that neither men nor vittels could
go or come by that waie. After this, the earle caused certeine bulworkes to be made
round about the towne, casting trenches betw&eacute;ene the one and the other, laieng
ordinance in euerie place where he saw that any batterie might be deuised. When
they within saw that they were enuironed with fortresses and ordinance, they laid
gun against gun, and fortified towers against bulworkes, and within cast new rampiers,
and fortified themselues as stronglie as might be deuised.</p>

<p>The bastard of Orleance and the Hire were appointed to s&eacute;e the walles and watches
kept, and the bishop saw that the inhabitants within the citie were put in good order,
and that vittels were not vainelie spent. In the tower that was taken at the bridge
end (as before you haue heard) there was an high chamber, hauing a grate full of
barres of iron, by the which a man might looke all the length of the bridge into the
citie; at which grate manie of the ch&eacute;efe capteins stood manie times, viewing the
citie, and deuising in what place it was best to giue the assault. They within the citie
well perceiued this tooting hole, and laid a p&eacute;ece of ordinance directlie against the
window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The earle of Salisburie slaine.</div>

<p>It so chanced, that the nine and fiftith daie after the siege was laid, the earle of
Salisburie, sir Thomas Gargraue, and William Glasdale, with diuerse other went into
the said tower, and so into the high chamber, and looked out at the grate, and within
a short space, the sonne of the maister-gunner, perceiuing men looking out at the
window, tooke his match (as his father had taught him who was gone downe to dinner),
and fired the gun; the shot whereof brake, and shiuered the iron barres of the
grate, so that one of the same bars strake the earle so violentlie on the head, that it
stroke awaie one of his eies, and the side of his ch&eacute;eke. Sir Thomas Gargraue was
likewise striken, and died within two daies.</p>

<p>The earle was conueied to Meun on Loire, where after eight daies he likewise departed
this world, whose bodie was conueied into England with all funerall appointment,
and buried at Bissam by his progenitors, leauing behind him an onelie daughter
named Alice, married to Richard Neuill, sonne to Rafe earle of Westmerland, of
whome more shall be said h&eacute;ereafter. The damage that the realme of England receiued
by the losse of this noble man, manifestlie appeared; in that immediatlie after
his death, the prosperous good lucke, which had followed the English nation, began
to decline, and the glorie of their victories gotten in the parties beyond the sea fell in
decaie.</p>

<p>Though all men were sorowfull for his death, yet the duke of Bedford was most
striken with heauinesse, as he that had lost his onelie right hand, and ch&eacute;efe aid in time
of necessitie. But sith that dead men cannot helpe the chances of men that be liuing,
he like a prudent gouernour appointed the earle of Suffolke to be his lieutenant and
capteine of the siege, and ioined with him the lord Scales, the lord Talbot, sir Iohn
Fastolfe, and diuerse other right valiant capteins. These persons caused bastilles to
be made round about the citie, and left nothing vnattempted, that might aduance
their purpose, which to bring to wished effect there was not anie want, as of no cautelous
policie, so of no valiant enterprise, tending to the enimies ouerthrow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1429.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Enguerant.</i></div>

<p>In the Lent season, vittels and artillerie began to waxe scant in the English campe,
wherefore the earle of Suffolke appointed sir Iohn Fastolfe, sir Thomas Rampston,
and sir Philip Hall, with their retinues, to ride to Paris, to the lord regent, to informe
him of their lacke, who incontinentlie vpon that information prouided vittels, artillerie,
and munitions necessarie, and loded therewith manie chariots, carts, and horsses:
and for the sure conueieng of the same, he appointed sir Simon Morhier, prouost
of Paris, with the gard of the citie, and diuerse of his owne houshold-seruants
to accompanie sir Iohn Fastolfe and his complices, to the armie lieng at the siege
of Orleance. They were in all to the number of fift&eacute;ene hundred men, of the which
there were not past fiue or six hundred Englishmen.</p>

<p>These departing in good order of battell out of Paris, came to Genuille in Beausse,
and in a morning earlie, in a great frost, they departed from thence toward the siege;
and when they came to a towne called Rowraie, in the lands of Beausse, they perceiued
their enimies comming towards them, being to the number of nine or ten thousand
of Frenchmen and Scots, of whome were capteins Charles of Cleremont, sonne
to the duke of Bourbon then being prisoner in England; sir William Steward constable
of Scotland, a little before deliuered out of captiuitie, the earle of Perdriake
the lord Iohn Vandosme, the Vidame of Chartres, the lord of Toures, the lord of
Lohar, the lord of Eglere, the lord of Beauiew, the bastard Tremoile, and manie
other valiant capteins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1500 English did slaie and v&auml;quish 10000 French.</div>

<p>Wherefore sir Iohn Fastolfe set all his companie in good order of battell, and
pitched stakes before euerie archer, to breake the force of the horssemen. At their
backes they set all the wagons and carriages, and within them they tied all their horsses.
In this maner stood they still, abiding the assault of their enimies. The Frenchmen
by reason of their great number, thinking themselues sure of the victorie, egerlie set
on the Englishmen, which with great force them receiued, and themselues manfullie
defended. At length, after long and cruell fight, the Englishmen droue backe and
vanquished the proud Frenchmen, &amp; compelled them to fl&eacute;e. In this conflict were
slaine the lord William Steward constable of Scotland, and his brother the lord Dorualle,
the lord Chateaubriam, sir Iohn Basgot, and other Frenchmen and Scots, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the number of fiue and twentie hundred, and aboue eleuen hundred taken prisoners,
although the French writers affirme the number lesse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The battell of herrings.</div>

<p>After this fortunate victorie, sir Iohn Fastolfe and his companie (hauing lost no one
man of anie reputation) with all their cariages, vittels, and prisoners, marched foorth
and came to the English campe before Orleance, where they were ioifullie receiued,
and highlie commended for their valiancie and worthie prowesse shewed in the battell;
the which bicause most part of the cariage was herring and lenton stuffe, the Frenchmen
called it the battell of herrings. The earle of Suffolke being thus vittelled,
continued the siege, and euerie daie almost skirmished with the Frenchmen within,
who (at length being in despaire of all succours) offered to treat, and in conclusion, to
saue themselues and the citie from captiuitie of their enimies, they deuised to submit
the citie, themselues, and all theirs vnder the obeisance of Philip duke of Burgognie,
bicause he was extract out of the stocke and bloud roiall of the ancient kings of
France, thinking by this means (as they did in d&eacute;ed) to breake or diminish the great
amitie betw&eacute;ene the Englishmen and him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<p>This offer was signified by them vnto the duke of Burgognie, who with thanks
certified them againe, that he would gladlie receiue them, if the lord regent would
therewith be contented. Herevpon he dispatched messengers to the duke of Bedford,
who though some counselled that it should be verie good and necessarie for him to
agr&eacute;e to that maner of y&eacute;elding; yet he and other thought it neither conuenient nor
honourable, that a citie so long besieged by the king of England, should be deliuered
vnto anie other prince, than to him, or to his regent, for that might be a verie bad president
to other townes in anie like case. Herevpon the regent answered the Burgognian
ambassadors: that after so long a siege on his part, and obstinat a resistance of
theirs, he might not receiue rendring and conditions at their appointment. At this
answer the duke hoong the groine, as concerning that our side should enuie his glorie,
or not to be so forward in aduancing his honour as he would haue it.</p>

<p>In time of this siege at Orleance (French stories saie) the first w&eacute;eke of March 1428,
vnto Charles the Dolphin, at Chinon as he was in verie great care and studie how to
wrestle against the English nation, by one Peter Badricourt capteine of Vacouleur,
(made after marshall of France by the Dolphins creation) was caried a yoong wench
of an eight&eacute;ene y&eacute;eres old, called Ione Arc, by name of hir father (a sorie sh&eacute;epheard)
Iames of Arc, and Isabell hir mother, brought vp poorelie in their trade of k&eacute;eping
cattell, borne at Domprin (therefore reported by Bale, Ione Domprin) vpon Meuse in
Loraine within the diocesse of Thoule. Of fauour was she counted likesome, of
person stronglie made and manlie, of courage great, hardie, and stout withall, an
vnderstander of counsels though she were not at them, great semblance of chastitie
both of bodie and behauiour, the name of Iesus in hir mouth about all hir businesses,
humble, obedient, and fasting diuerse daies in the w&eacute;eke. A person (as their bookes
make hir) raised vp by power diuine, onelie for succour to the French estate then
d&eacute;epelie in distresse, in whome, for planting a credit the rather, first the companie
that toward the Dolphin did conduct hir, through places all dangerous, as holden
by the English, where she neuer was afore, all the waie and by nightertale safelie
did she lead; then at the Dolphins sending by hir assignement, from saint Katharins
church of Fierbois in Touraine (where she neuer had b&eacute;ene and knew not) in a secret
place there among old iron, appointed she hir sword to be sought out and brought
hir, that with fiue floure delices was grauen on both sides, wherewith she fought
&amp; did manie slaughters by hir owne hands. On warfar rode she in armour <a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> cap a
pie &amp; mustered as a man, before hir an ensigne all white, wherin was Iesus Christ
painted with a floure delice in his hand.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="sidenote"><i>Les grand chronic.</i></div>

<p>Vnto the Dolphin into his gallerie when first she was brought, and he shadowing
himselfe behind, setting other gaie lords before him to trie hir cunning from all the
companie, with a salutation (that ind&eacute;ed marz all the matter) she pickt him out
alone, who therevpon had hir to the end of the gallerie, where she held him an houre
in secret and priuate talke, that of his priuie chamber was thought verie long, and therefore
would haue broken it off; but he made them a sign to let hir saie on. In which
(among other) as likelie it was, she set out vnto him the singular feats (forsooth)
giuen her to vnderstand by reuelation diuine, that in vertue of that sword sh&eacute;e
should atchiue, which were, how with honor and victorie sh&eacute;e would raise the siege
at Orleance, set him in state of the crowne of France, and driue the English out of
the countrie, thereby he to inioie the kingdome alone. H&eacute;erevpon he hartened at
full, appointed hir a sufficient armie with absolute power to lead them, and they
obedientlie to doo as she bad them. Then fell she to worke, and first defeated ind&eacute;ed
the siege at Orleance, by and by incouraged him to crowne himselfe king of France
at Reims, that a little before from the English she had woone. Thus after pursued
she manie bold enterprises to our great displeasure a two yeare togither, for the
time she kept in state vntill she were taken and for heresie and witcherie burned:
as in particularities hereafter followeth. But in hir prime time she armed at all
points (like a iolie capteine) roade from Poictiers to Blois, and there found men of
warre, vittels, and munition, ready to be conueied to Orleance.</p>

<p>H&eacute;ere was it knowne that the Englishmen kept not so diligent watch as they had
b&eacute;ene accustomed to doo, and therefore this maid (with other French capteins)
comming forward in the dead time of the night, and in a great raine and thunder
entred into the citie with all their vittels, artillerie, and other necessarie prouisions.
The next daie the Englishmen boldlie assaulted the towne, but the Frenchmen defended
the walles so, as no great feat worthie of memorie chanced that daie betwixt
them, though the Frenchmen were amazed at the valiant attempt of the Englishmen,
whervpon the bastard of Orleance gaue knowledge to the duke of Alanson, in what
danger the towne stood without his present helpe, who comming within two leagues
of the citie, gaue knowledge to them within, that they should be readie the next
daie to receiue him.</p>

<p>This accordinglie was accomplished: for the Englishmen willinglie suffered him
and his armie also to enter, supposing that it should be for their aduantage to haue
so great a multitude to enter the citie, whereby their vittels (whereof they within had
great scarsitie) might the sooner be consumed. On the next daie in the morning, the
Frenchmen altogither issued out of the towne, woone by assault the bastile of saint
Lou, and set it on fire. And after they likewise assaulted the tower at the bridge
foot, which was manfullie defended. But the Frenchmen (more in number) at length
tooke it, yer the lord Talbot could come to the succours, in the which William Gladesdale
the capteine was slaine, with the lord Moolins, and lord Poinings also.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen puffed vp with this good lucke, fetched a compasse about, and in
good order of battell marched toward the bastile, which was in the k&eacute;eping of the
lord Talbot: the which vpon the enimies approch, like a capteine without all feare or
dread of that great multitude, issued foorth againt them, and gaue them so sharpe an
incounter, that they not able to withstand his puissance, fled (like sh&eacute;epe before the
woolfe) againe into the citie, with great losse of men and small artillerie. Of Englishmen
were lost in the two Bastiles, to the number of six hundred persons, or
thereabout, though the French writers multiplie this number of hundreds to thousands,
as their maner is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The siege of Orleance broken vp.</div>

<p>The earle of Suffolke, the lord Talbot, the lord Scales, and other capteins assembled
togither in councell, and after causes shewed to and fro, it was amongst them determined
to leaue their fortresses and bastiles, and to assemble in the plaine field, and
there to abide all the daie to s&eacute;e if the Frenchmen would issue foorth to fight with
them. This conclusion taken was accordinglie executed: but when the Frenchmen
durst not once come foorth to shew their heads, the Englishmen set fire of their
lodgings, and departed in good order of Battell from Orleance. The next daie, which
was the eight daie of Maie, the earle of Suffolke rode to Iargeaux with foure hundred
Englishmen, and the lord Talbot with an other companie returned to Mehun. And
after he had fortified that towne, he went to the towne of Lauall, and woone it, togither
with the castell, sore punishing the townsmen for their cankered obstinacie
against them.</p>

<p>Thus when the Englishmen had seuered themselues into garrisons, the duke of
Alanson, the bastard of Orleance, Ione le Pusell, the lord Gawcourt, and diuerse
other capteins of the Frenchmen, came the twelfe daie of Iune, before the towne of
Iargeaux, where the earle of Suffolke and his two brethren soiourned, &amp; gaue to the
towne so fierce an assault on thr&eacute;e parts, that Poiton de Sentrailes, perceiuing an other
part void of defendants, scaled the wals on that side, and without difficultie tooke
the towne, and slue sir Alexander Poole, brother to the erle, and manie other, to the
number of two hundred. But the Frenchmen gained not much thereby, for they lost
thr&eacute;e hundred good men and more. Of the Englishmen fortie were taken, with the
earle and his other brother named Iohn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prisoners slaine by the French as they were taken.</div>

<p>The Frenchmen, as they returned to Orleance, fell at variance for their prisoners,
and slue them all, sauing the earle and his brother. Shortlie after, the same French
armie came to Mehun, where they tooke the tower at the bridge foot, and put therein
a garrison. From thence they remooued to Baugencie, and constreined them that
were within the towne to y&eacute;eld, vpon condition they might depart with bag and baggage.
At the same place there came to the duke of Alanson, the new constable Arthur
of Britaine, and with him the lord Dalbret, and other. Also after this the earle
of Vandosme came to them, so that by the dailie repaire of such as assembled togither
to strengthen the French part, they were in all to the number betw&eacute;ene twentie and
thr&eacute;e and twentie thousand men.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Nichol. Giles.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Fiue thousa&#x0304;d saith <i>Hall</i>.</div>

<p>All which being once ioined in one armie, shortlie after fought with the lord Talbot
(who had with him not past six thousand men) n&eacute;ere vnto a village in Beausse
called Pataie: at which battell the charge was giuen by the French so vpon a sudden,
that the Englishmen had not leisure to put themselues in arraie, after they had put vp
their stakes before their archers, so that there was no remedie but to fight at aduenture.
This battell continued by the space of thr&eacute;e long houres; for the Englishmen, though
they were ouerpressed with multitude of their enimies, yet they neuer fled backe one
foot, till their capteine the lord Talbot was sore wounded at the backe, and so
taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great losse on the English side. The lords Talbot, Scales, and Hungerford taken.</div>

<p>Then their hearts began to faint, and they fled, in which flight were slaine aboue
twelue hundred, and fortie taken, of whome the lord Talbot, the lord Scales, the
lord Hungerford, &amp; sir Thomas Rampston were ch&eacute;efe. Diuerse archers, after they
had shot all their arrowes, hauing onelie their swords, defended themselues, and with
helpe of some of their horsmen came safe to Mehun. This ouerthrow, and speciallie
the taking of the lord Talbot, did not so much reioise the Frenchmen; but it did as
much abash the Englishmen: so that immediatlie therevpon, the townes of Ienuile,
Mehun, Fort, and diuerse other, returned from the English part, and became French.
From this battell departed without anie stroke striken sir Iohn Fastolfe, the same
yeare for his valiantnesse elected into the order of the garter. But for doubt of misdealing
at this brunt, the duke of Bedford tooke from him the image of saint George,
and his garter; though afterward by meanes of fr&eacute;ends, and apparant causes of good
excuse, the same were to him againe deliuered against the mind of the lord Talbot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The French king crowned.</div>

<p>Charles the Dolphin that called himselfe French K. perceiuing fortune to smile thus
vpon him, assembled a great power, and determined to conquer the citie of Reimes,
that he might be there sacred, crowned, and annointed, according to the custome of
his progenitours, that all men might iudge that he was by all lawes and decr&eacute;es a
iust and lawfull king. In his waie thitherwards he besieged the citie of Auxerre, the
citizens whereof compounded with him to y&eacute;eld, if they were not rescued within
certeine daies. From thence he came before Trois, and after twelue daies siege had
that citie deliuered vnto him, by composition, that the capteine sir Philip Hall (with
his people and mooueables) might depart in safetie. After that Trois was y&eacute;elded,
the communaltie of Chaalons rebelled against sir Iohn Aubemond their capteine, and
constreined him to deliuer the towne vpon like composition. In semblable manner
did they of Reimes, desiring him to giue safe conduct to all the Englishmen safelie to
depart. When Reimes was thus become French, the foresaid Charles the Dolphin in
the presence of the dukes of Lorraine and Barr&eacute;, and of all the noble men of his faction,
was sacred there king of France by the name of Charles the seauenth, with all
rites and ceremonies thereto belonging. They of Auxerre, when the terme of their
appointment was expired, submitted themselues to him; and so likewise did all the
cities and townes adioining.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ione taken to be a witch.</div>

<p>The duke of Bedford aduertised of all these dooings, assembled his power about
him, and hauing togither ten thousand good Englishmen (beside Normans) departed
out of Paris in warlike fashion, and passing thorough Brie to Monstreau fault Yonne,
sent by his herald Bedford, letters to the French king, signifieng to him; that where he
had (contrarie to the finall conclusion accorded betw&eacute;ene his noble brother K. Henrie
the fift, &amp; king Charles the sixt, father to him that was the vsurper) by allurement of
a deuelish witch, taken vpon him the name, title, &amp; dignitie of the king of France;
and further had by murther, stealing, craft, and deceitfull meanes, violentlie gotten,
and wrongfullie kept diuerse cities and townes belonging to the king of England
his nephue; for proofe thereof he was come downe from Paris with his armie, into
the countrie of Brie, by dint of sword and stroke of battell to prooue his writing and
cause true, willing his enimie to choose the place, and in the same he would giue him
battell.</p>

<p>The new French king being come from Reimes to Dampmartine, studieng how
to compasse them of Paris, was halfe abashed at this message. But yet to set a
good countenance on the matter, he answered the herald, that he would sooner s&eacute;eke
his maister, than his maister should n&eacute;ed to pursue him. The duke of Bedford
hearing this answer, marched toward the king, and pitched his field in a strong
place. The French king, though at the first he meant to haue abidden battell; yet
when he vnderstood that the duke was equall to him in number of people, he
changed his purpose, and turned with his armie a little out of the waie. The duke
of Bedford, perceiuing his faint courage, followed him by the hils and dales, till he
came to a town not far from Senlis, where he found the French king and his armie
lodged; wherefore he ordered his battels like an expert ch&eacute;efteine in martiall science,
setting the archers before, and himselfe with the noblemen in the maine battell, and
put the Normans on both sides for wings. The French king also ordered his battels
with the aduise of his capteins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French armie fled in the night.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Boheme.</div>

<p>Thus these two armies laie two daies and two nights either in sight of other, without
anie great dooing, except a few skirmishes, wherein the dukes light horssemen did
verie valiantlie. At length in the dead of the night (as priuilie as might be) the
French king brake vp his campe, and fled to Braie. The duke of Bedford had much
adoo to staie his people in the morning from pursuit of the French armie: but for that
he mistrusted the Parisiens, he would not depart farre from that citie, and so returned
thither againe. &para; In this season pope Martin the fift of that name, meaning
to subdue the Bohemers that dissented from the church of Rome in matters of religion,
appointed Henrie Beaufort Bishop of Winchester &amp; cardinall of saint Eusebie, to be
his legat in an armie that should inuade the kingdome of Boheme, and to bring a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
power of men with him out of England. And because the warre touched religion, he
licenced the cardinall to take the tenth part of euerie spirituall dignitie, benefice, and
promotion.</p>

<p>This matter was opened in the parlement house, and assented to: wherevpon the
bishop gathered the monie, and assembled foure thousand men &amp; aboue, not without
great grudge of the people, which dailie were with tallages and aids wearied and sore
burdened. As this bishop was come to Douer readie to passe the seas ouer into Flanders,
the duke of Glocester hauing receiued letters from the duke of Bedford, conteining
an earnest request to rel&eacute;eue him with some sp&eacute;edie aid of men of warre, was
constreined to write vnto the bishop of Winchester, willing him in time of such n&eacute;ed,
when all stood vpon losse or gaine, to passe with all his armie toward the duke of
Bedford, to assist him against his aduersaries; which thing doone, and to his honour
atchiued, he might performe his iournie against the vngratious Bohemers. The cardinall
(though not well contented with this countermand) yet least he should run into
the note of infamie, if he refused to aid the regent of France in so great a cause, passed
ouer with his power, and brought the same vnto his coosine to the citie of Paris.</p>

<p>About the same season, the French king, in hope to be receiued into the townes
of Campaigne and Beauuois (by reason of the fauour and good will which the inhabitants
bare towards him) was come with an armie towards Campaigne. Whereof
the duke of Bedford being aduertised, and hauing now his host augmented with the
new supplie, which the cardinall had of late brought vnto him, marched forward
with great sp&eacute;ed toward the place where he vnderstood the French king was lodged:
and comming to Senlis, he perceiued how his enimies were incamped vpon the mount
Pilioll, betw&eacute;ene Senlis and Campaigne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 8.</div>

<p>Here might either armie behold the other: wherevpon for the auoiding of dangers
that might insue, the campes were trenched, and the battels pitched, and the
fields ordered as though they should haue tried the matter by battell: but nothing
was doone except with skirmishes, in the which the Normans sore vexed the Frenchmen;
and therefore receiued great commendations and praises of the lord regent:
who vndoubtedlie determined to haue giuen battell to his enimies if they would haue
abidden it. But after the armies had thus lien ether in sight of other, for the space
of two daies together, the French king not determining to aduenture in an open
battell the whole chance of the game, least he might thereby receiue a perpetuall
checkemate, in the night season remooued his campe, and fled to Crespie, though
his number was double to the English armie. The duke of Bedford, s&eacute;eing that
the French king was thus cowardlie recoiled with all his power and armie, returned
againe to Paris, euer suspecting the deceitfull faith of the Parisiens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boheme.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The pope did vnlegat the cardinall of Winchester.</div>

<div class="sidenote">K. Henries coronation at Westminster.</div>

<p>The bishop of Winchester, after that the French king was retreated backe, went
into Boheme, and there did somewhat, though shortlie after without anie great
praise or gaine he returned into England, more glad of his comming backe than of
his aduancing forward. Anon after the pope vnlegated him, and set an other in his
place, wherewith he was nothing contented. On the sixt daie of Nouember, being
the daie of saint Leonard, king Henrie in the eight yeare of his reigne was at
Westminster with all pompe and honour crowned king of this realme of England.
In the same yere the French king was receiued into the towne of Campaigne, and
shortlie after were the townes of Senlis and Beauuois rendered to him. And the
lord Longueall tooke by stelth the castell of Aumarle, and slue all the Englishmen
within it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Thom. Wals.</i></div>

<p>Also about the same time, the Frenchmen recouered castell Gaillard foorth of the
Englishmens hands, where the lord Barbason was found in a dungeon, inclosed
within a great grate of iron like to a little chamber, and foorthwith they brake open the
grate: but Barbason would not come foorth;, because he had giuen his faith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
promise to one Kingston that was capteine of that fortresse for the king of England,
to be true prisoner, vntill the Frenchmen had sent to the same Kingston (that was
departed vpon such couenants as they were agr&eacute;ed vpon at the deliuerie of that fortresse)
willing him to come backe againe vpon safe conduct. Which at their earnest
request he did, and withall discharged the lord Barbason of his oth; and so then he
came foorth, and remained at his libertie, to the great reioising of the Frenchmen,
which iudged that he had b&eacute;ene rather dead than aliue all that time of his imprisonment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A parlement at Rone called by the duke of Bedford.</div>

<p>About the same time also the French king sought by all meanes possible to breake
the amitie betwixt the realme of England, and the house of Burgognie. Whereof
the duke of Bedford hauing intelligence, thought it stood him vpon the more earnestlie
to looke to his charge; and namelie as it were an anchorhold, he determined to
prouide that he might defend and safelie k&eacute;epe the duchie of Normandie, and therefore
appointing the bishop of Terrowen and Elie, named Lewes of Lutzenburgh,
chancellor for king Henrie of the realme of France, to remaine at Paris vpon the
defense of that citie, with a conuenient number of Englishmen, he departed into
Normandie, and comming to Rone, called a parlement there of the thr&eacute;e estates of the
duchie, in the which he declared manie things vnto them, touching the happie life,
and great fr&eacute;edome which they might be assured to inioy, so long as they continued
vnder the English obeisance: and therefore he exhorted them to abide constant in
their allegiance, faith, and promise made and sworne to his noble brother king Henrie
the fift.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French got saint Denis.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ione had a hurt in the leg and a fall, drawen all durtie out of the mire.</div>

<p>Whilest the duke of Bedford was busie to reteine the Normans in their due obedience,
the French king departed from Senlis; and comming to the towne of saint
Denis, found it in maner desolate, so that he entered there without resistance, and
lodged his armie at Mount Martyr and Amberuilliers, n&eacute;ere vnto the citie of Paris;
and from thence sent Iohn duke of Alanson, and his sorceresse Ione la Pusell, with
thr&eacute;e thousand light horssemen to asssault the citie, and followed himselfe, in hope to
get it, either by force or treatie. But the English capteins euerie one k&eacute;eping his
ward and place assigned, so manfullie defended themselues, their walles and towers
with the assistance of the Parisiens, that they repelled the Frenchmen, and threw
downe Ione their great goddesse into the bottome of the towne ditch, where she lay
behind the backe of an asse sore hurt in the leg, till the time that she (all filthie with
mire and durt) was drawne out by Guischard of Thienbrone, seruant to the duke of
Alanson.</p>

<p>The French king, perceiuing that he could not preuaile in this enterprise, left the
dead bodies behind him, and taking with him the wounded capteins, returned into
Berrie. But in the meane waie, the inhabitants of Laignie submitted themselues vnto
him. The duke of Bedford being in Normandie, hearing of this sudden attempt,
with all hast possible came to Paris, where he gaue manie great thanks, with high
commendations vnto the capteins, souldiers and citizens for their assured fidelitie,
great hardinesse &amp; manlie dooing. Which his gentle words so incouraged the harts
of the Parisiens, that they sware, promised and concluded, to be fr&eacute;ends for euer
to the king of England, and his fr&eacute;ends, and enimies alwaies to his foes and aduersaries,
making proclamation by this stile: "Fr&eacute;ends to K. Henrie, fr&eacute;ends to the Parisiens;
Enimies to England, enimies to Paris." Marie whether this was vttered from
their harts, it is hard so to saie, for the sequeale of their acts s&eacute;emed to proue the
contrarie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Saint Denis by vs recouered againe.</div>

<p>Soone after these dooings, came to Paris with a great companie Philip duke of Burgognie,
and then vpon long consultation had for the recouerie of their losses, it was
agr&eacute;ed that the duke of Bedford should raise an armie, &amp; that the duke of Burgognie
should be his deputie, and tarie at Paris for the defense of the citie. The duke of
Bedford then without any great resistance recouered againe the towne of saint Denis,
with diuerse other fortresses. And after this he sent the bastard of Clarence to laie
siege to the castell of Torsie, the which (notwithstanding the great strength therof)
after six moneths siege, was rendred vp into his hands. During the siege of this
castell, sir Thomas Kiriell knight, with foure hundred Englishmen departed from
Gourneie in Normandie, and rode by Beauuois, spoiling and wasting the countrie
to the suburbes of Cleremont. Whereof the earle of that towne hauing aduertisement,
assembled all the men of warre of the garrisons adioining, and with the same set
forward to fight with the Englishmen, whom he found in a streict place n&eacute;ere to
Beauuois.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Le Rosier.</i></div>

<p>The earle of Cleremont, perceiuing that he could not hurt them with his men of
armes, by reason of the strength, came downe on foot with all his companie, and
fiercelie set on the Englishmen: but by the terrible shot of the English archers, the
Frenchmen in the end were constreined to fl&eacute;e; and the Englishmen perceiuing the
matter, streight leapt on horssebacke and followed the chase. In the which were
taken two hundred prisoners, and thrise as manie slaine. The earle escaped by the
swiftnesse of his horsse. At the same season the earle of Suffolke besieging the
towne of Aumarle (whereof was capteine the lord of Rambures) after foure and
twentie great assaults, had the towne and castell simplie to him rendred. Thus by
little and little the Englishmen recouered manie townes which before they had lost.
Howbeit about the verie same time, the Frenchmen stale the towne of Lauall, by
treason wrought by a miller, which k&eacute;eping a mill that ioined to the wall, suffered
the French to passe through his mill into the towne. Shortlie after also sir Steuen de
Vignoilles, surnamed la Hire, tooke by scaling the towne of Louiers in Normandie.
The Englishmen in the cold moneth of December besieged the towne of Laignie in
the which was the Pusell, and diuerse other good capteins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Campiegne besieged.</div>

<p>After this the duke of Bourgognie accompanied with the earles of Arundell, and
Suffolke, and the lord Iohn of Lutzenburgh besieged the towne of Campiegne with
a great puissance. This towne was well walled, manned and vittelled, so that the
besiegers were constreined to cast trenches, and make mines, for otherwise they saw
not how to compasse their purpose. In the meane time it happened in the night of
the Ascension of our lord, that Poiton de Saintreiles, Ione la Pusell, and fiue or six

flourish: who by the prouidence of God grew in such fauour with this king Henrie

so fast that one letted another, as they would haue entered. In the chase and pursute
was the Pusell taken, with diuerse other, besides those that were slaine, which were

<p>Wherein the cause was so sincerelie canuassed among them, that afterward, on the
eight of Iulie 1456, a quite contrarie sentence was there declared; of effect, that this
Ione (forsooth) was a damsell diuine, no fault in the Dolphin for his counsell and witcherie
practises with hir; the processe, iudgement, and condemnation against hir all
wrong and iniurious. And for iustification and remembrance aswell of hir innocencie

somewhat also to carpe at hir iudgment, and much pitieth hir paine. But what puritie
or regard of deuotion or conscience is in these writers trow y&eacute;e, who make no consideration
of hir heinous enormities, or else any difference betw&eacute;ene one stirred vp by
mercie diuine, or naturall loue, and a damnable sorcerer suborned by satan? And thus
much of this gentle Ione, and of hir good oratours that haue said so well for hir: now
iudge as ye list.]</p>

<p>After the bestowing of this Pusell in sort as y&eacute;e haue heard, the siege still continued
before Campiegne, and the duke of Bedford sent to the duke of Burgognie lieng at the
siege, the earle of Huntington, and sir Iohn Robsert (two iollie gentlemen, of no lesse
prudence to parle with the enimie, than puissance to incounter them) with a thousand
archers (whose actiuitie, I warrant you, stood not then vpon the first triall) which
dailie skirmished with them within, and made such bastiles &amp; fortresses, that the towne
had b&eacute;ene rendred into their hands, but that the duke of Burgognie departed from
the siege to go into Brabant, to receiue the possession of that duchie, by the death of
his cousin Philip the duke of that countrie, as then departed this world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 9.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1431.</div>

<p>Sir Iohn de Lutzenburgh was left by the duke of Burgognie as generall of the siege
before Campiegne, the which he raised within a short space after, contrarie to the
minds of the Englishmen, which were verie desirous to haue lien there till the towne
had b&eacute;ene rendered, which if the siege had b&eacute;ene continued but eight daies longer,
must n&eacute;eds haue come to passe; by reason that pestilence and famine had almost consumed
all the souldiers within the towne, so that it remained in maner without defense.
After the breaking vp of this siege, Iohn duke of Norffolke tooke againe the townes
of Dampmartine, and the Chasse Mongaie, with diuerse other townes. Also the earle
of Stafford tooke the towne of Brin countie Robert, and from thence forraged all the
countrie to Sens, and after tooke Quesnoie in Brie, Grand Puis, and Rampellon.</p>

<p>During this time, the Frenchmen on the otherside tooke Louiers and Villeneuf.
Then also did the towne of Melun rebell, and had such aid of other townes adioining,
that the English souldiers were faine to leaue Melun, Morret, and Corbell. Thus did
things wauer in doubtfull balance betwixt the two nations English and French. But
bicause the English sore mistrusted further danger, it was concluded, that king Henrie
in his roiall person with a new armie should come into France, partlie to visit and comfort
his owne subiects there, and partlie either by feare or fauour (bicause a child of
his age and beautie dooth commonlie procure them loue of elder persons) to moue
the Frenchmen to continue their due obeisance towards him.</p>

diuerse riots, and punished the offenders) the king with a great power tooke
shipping at Douer on saint Georges euen within night, and landed at Calis on the
morrow being saint Georges daie, and sundaie, by seuen of the clocke in the morning.
He remained in Calis a good space, and from thence he remoued to Rone, being there
receiued with all triumph. He taried in that citie a long time, his nobles dailie consulting
on their great businesse &amp; weightie affaires.</p>

<p>Neuerthelesse, God (whose mercifull nature abhorreth the effusion of mans bloud)

were not able to rescue him out of the womens hands; who had sworne in their hearts

<p>But to returne to the affaires of king Henrie, who in the moneth of Nouember
remooued from Rone to Pontoise, and so to saint Denis, to the intent to make his
entrie into Paris, and there to be sacred king of France. There were in his companie
of his owne nation, his vncle the cardinall of Winchester, the cardinall and archbishop
of Yorke, the dukes of Bedford, Yorke, and Norffolke, the earles of Warwike,
Salisburie, Oxenford, Huntington, Ormond, Mortaigne, and Suffolke. Of Gascoigns,
there were the earles of Longuille and Marche, besides manie other noble men
of England, Guien, and Normandie. And the ch&eacute;efe of the French nation were the
dukes of Burgognie, and Lewes of Lutzenburgh, cardinall and chancellor of France
for king Henrie: the bishops of Beauuois and Noion, both p&eacute;eres of France, beside
the bishop of Paris, and diuerse other bishops; the earle of Vaudemount, and other
noble men, whose names were superfluous to rehearse. And he had in a gard about
his person thr&eacute;e thousand price archers, some on horssebacke, and part on foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Henrie the sixt crowned in Paris.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Le Rosier historiad.</i></div>

<p>To speake with what honour he was receiued into the citie of Paris, what pageants

hanged with costlie clothes of arras &amp; tapestrie, it would be too long a processe, and
therefore I doo h&eacute;ere passe it ouer with silence. On the seauent&eacute;enth daie of December,
he was crowned king of France, in our ladie church of Paris, by the cardinall of
Winchester, the bishop of Paris not being contented that the cardinall should doo
such an high ceremonie in his church and iurisdiction. After all the ceremonies were
finished, the king returned toward the palace, hauing one crowne on his head, and
another borne before him; and one scepter in his hand, and the second borne before
him. As touching other the roiall seruices and princelie appointments, they are verie
diligentlie &amp; at large set out in the French chronicle of that time. This coronation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of the king, Anglorum pr&aelig;lia as manie other good and memorable matters, so this also
he hath noted, saieng thereof in comelie breuitie and truth, as after followeth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>This high and ioious feast passed not without some spot of displeasure among the
English nobilitie: for the cardinall of Winchester, which at this time would haue no
man be equall with him, commanded the duke of Bedford to leaue off the name
of regent, during the time that the king was in France, affirming the ch&eacute;efe ruler
being in presence, the authoritie of the substitute to be cl&eacute;erlie derogate, according
to the common saieng; In the presence of the higher power, the smaller giueth
place. The duke of Bedford tooke such a secret displeasure with this dooing, that
he neuer after fauoured the cardinall, but stood against him in all things that
he would haue forward. This was the root (as some haue thought) of that diuision
amongst the English nobilitie, where through their glorie within the realme of
France began first to decline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Montargis recouered by the English.</div>

<p>The next daie after the solemne feast of the kings coronation, were kept triumphant
iusts and torneis, in the which the earle of Arundell, and the bastard of S. Paule,
by the iudgement of the ladies woone the price. The king kept open hall the space
of fiue daies to all commers, and after (bicause the aire of Paris s&eacute;emed contrarie to
his pure complexion) by the aduise of his councell, he remooued to Rone, where
he kept his Christmasse. But before his departure from Paris, the noble men as
well of France and Normandie did to him homage, and the common people sware
to him fealtie. In this meane time, sir Francis called the Aragoignois, a noble
capteine of the English part in Normandie, tooke by force and policie the towne of
Montargis, with a great preie of treasure and prisoners, and put therein a garrison,
leauing it well furnished with vittels and munition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Talbot ransomed by exchange.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The holie sh&eacute;epheard.</div>

<p>About the same time, the earle of Arundell, being truelie informed that the lord
Bousac, marshall of France, was come to Beauuois, intending to doo some feat in
Normandie, assembled the number of thr&eacute;e and twentie hundred men, and comming
n&eacute;ere to the said towne of Beauuois, sent a great number of light horssemen to run
before the towne, to traine out the Frenchmen within; the which issuing out and
following the English horssemen vnto their stale, were so inclosed and fought with,
that in maner all the number of them, saue a few which fled backe into the towne
with the marshall, were slaine or taken. Amongst other of the ch&eacute;efest prisoners,
that valiant capteine Pouton de Santrails was one, who without delaie was exchanged
for the lord Talbot, before taken prisoner at the battell of Pataie. There was also
taken one called the sh&eacute;epheard, a simple man, and a sillie soule; but yet of such
reputation for his supposed holinesse amongst the Frenchmen, that if he touched the
wall of any of their aduersaries townes, they bel&eacute;eued verelie it would incontinentlie
fall downe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vaudemont besieged.</div>

<p>This chance succ&eacute;eded not fortunatlie alone vnto the English nation, for Richard
Beauchampe earle of Warwike had a great skirmish before the towne of Gournie,
where he discomfited and repelled his enimies: and beside those that were slaine, he
tooke fortie horssemen, all being gentlemen of name and armes. Like chance happened
to the fr&eacute;ends of king Charles, towards the marches of Loraine, where Reigner
duke of Bar besieged the towne of Vaudemont perteining to the earle thereof named
Anthonie, coosine to the same duke Reigner. This earle, before the dukes approching,
left a conuenient crue within the towne to defend it, and with all sp&eacute;ed rode to
the dukes of Bedford and Burgognie, being then at the foresaid great triumph at
Paris, where he purchased such fauour at their hands, bicause he had euer taken
their parts, that not onelie sir Iohn Fastolfe was appointed to go with him, hauing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
in his companie six hundred archers, but also the duke of Burgognies marshall
named sir Anthonie Toulongon, accompanied with fift&eacute;ene hundred other men of
warre.</p>

<p>When the duke of Bar heard that his enimies were thus comming towards him,
like a hardie capteine he raised his siege, and met face to face with the earle and his
companie, betw&eacute;ene whome was a cruell and mortall battell. The horssemen of the
French side endured long, but in conclusion the English archers so galled their
horsses, and so wounded the men, that the Barrois, Almains, and other of duke
Reigners side were compelled to fl&eacute;e. In the chase was taken the duke of Bar, the
bishop of Metz, the lord of Roquedemaque, sir Euerard of Salseburgh, the vicont
Darcie, and two hundred other, beside thr&eacute;e thousand which were slaine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Saint Seuerine besieged.</div>

<p>In this luckie time also, no lesse occasion of victorie was offered to the Englishmen
in an other part, if they could haue vsed it with such circumspect warinesse as had
b&eacute;ene expedient. For Robert lord Willoughbie, and Matthew <a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>Gough, a valiant
Welshman, with fift&eacute;ene hundred Englishmen, laid siege to a towne in Aniou called
saint Seuerine. Whereof Charles the French king being aduertised, sent with all
sp&eacute;ed the lord Ambrose de Lore, with manie noble men to the succours of them within
the towne, wherof the same lord Ambrose was capteine: and therefore made the
more hast to rel&eacute;eue his deputie, and the other being streictlie besieged, but yet staied
at the towne of Beaumont, till his whole power might come to him.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> or rather Goche.</p></div>

<p>The Englishmen aduertised of this intent of the capteine, came vpon him in the
night, and found the Frenchmens watch so out of order, that a thousand men were
entered into the campe before they were espied; by reason whereof the Englishmen
found small resistance. But when the daie began to appeare, and that the sunne had
set foorth his bright beames abroad, that all things might be s&eacute;ene, the Englishmen
giuen wholie to spoile, followed not their enimies in chase, but being contented with
their preie and game, began to retreit toward the siege againe, which the lord Willoughbie
still mainteined with a part of the armie.</p>

<p>But s&eacute;e the chance. The Frenchmen which were co&#x0304;ming after, hearing by the noise
of the people that some fraie was at hand, put spurres to their horsses, and set on the
Englishmen pestered with bag and baggage of the spoile and preie which they had
gotten in the French campe. The other of the Frenchmen which before had fled,
returned againe, and aided their fellowes; so that the Englishmen being taken out
of order, were compelled to fl&eacute;e, of whome Matthew <a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>Gough and diuerse other
were taken prisoners. And yet of the other part manie were slaine, and a great
number taken: amongst whom was the lord de Lore, who (for all that the Frenchmen
could doo) was kept, and not deliuered. The lord Willoughbie hearing of this
mishap, raised his siege, and departed verie sore displeased in his mind, but could
not remedie it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The two errours.</div>

<p>About this season, Nicholas the cardinall of the holie crosse was sent into France,
as a legat from Eugenie the fourth as then bishop of Rome, to treat a peace betw&eacute;ene
the Englishmen and Frenchmen. But when after great instance and labour made betw&eacute;ene
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>the parties, he saw their obstinate and froward minds, nothing inclined to
anie agr&eacute;ement, he wan so much at their hands by earnest sute, that a truce was
granted to indure for six yeares to come: but as the same was hardlie granted, so
was it of the Frenchmen soone and lightlie broken. For the bastard of Orleance
newlie made earle of Dunois, tooke by treson the towne of Chartres from the Englishmen,
affirming by the law of armes, that stealing or buieng a towne, without
inuasion or assault, was no breach of league, amitie, or truce. In which towne he
slue the bishop, bicause he was a Burgognian. Hereby did new malice increase, and
mortall warre began eftsoones to be put in vse.</p>

<p>Whilest these things were dooing in France, the cardinall of Winchester was come
backe againe into England, to appease certeine commotions and sturres attempted
by sundrie persons vnder colour of religion: but after that William Mandeuile, and
Iohn Sharpe the ch&eacute;efe authors thereof were apprehended and executed by the
gouernour and the kings iustices, the residue y&eacute;elded and confessed their offenses,
whereof two articles were these (as some write) that priests should haue no possessions,
and that all things by order of charitie among christian people should be in
common. Other thought their opinions were not such errours, but that their enimies
spread abroad such rumors of them, to make them more odious to the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A parlement called by the duke of Glocester the king being in France.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A peace concluded with the Scots.</div>

<p>After that, a parlement was called by the duke of Glocester, in the which monie
was assigned to be leuied, and men appointed, which should passe ouer into France to
the aid of the duke of Bedford, for the maintenance of the warres: bicause it was suspected
the truce would not long continue. During this parlement, Iames the king of
Scots sent ambassadors to conclude a peace with the duke of Glocester, who (bicause
the king was absent) referred the matter to the thr&eacute;e estates. After long consultation,
not without great arguments, a peace was concluded. When the parlement was
ended, the cardinall well furnished with men &amp; monie, departed out of England, and
came to Rone to the king, to whome also resorted the duke of Bedford from Paris,
to consult of things not vnlikelie to follow.</p>

<p>Herevpon a great councell was kept in the castell of Rone, and manie doubts
mooued, and few weightie things out of hand concluded. At length, after great
disputation, with manie arguments ended, the dukes of Bedford and Yorke, and
Edmund late earle of Mortaigne, and now (by the death of Iohn duke of Summerset,
leauing behind him a sole daughter and heire, maried to the earle, and called Margaret
after the countesse of Richmond) atteined to the name and title of duke of Summerset,
approoued the reason of those, that held it expedient to haue an armie in a redinesse
for defense, least the Frenchmen suddenlie should attempt anie enterprise to the
danger of the Englishmen, and losse of those townes and countries that were vnder
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Henrie returneth out of France into England.</div>

<p>When all things were agr&eacute;ed, king Henrie came to Calis, from thence to Douer;
and so by easie iournies the one and twentith daie of Februarie to London, where he
was triumphantlie receiued, and richlie presented, as in the chronicles of Robert
Fabian it maie at large appeare. After that the king was departed into England,
the duke of Bedford regent of France, and captein of Calis, taried behind in the
marches of Picardie, where he was informed certeine souldiers of Calis grudging at
the restraint of woolles, began to murmur against the king and his councell, to some
danger of the towne. The duke vpon due examination had caused diuerse to be put
to death, and manie banished that towne and marches for euer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duchesse of Bedford sister to the duke of Burgognie deceassed.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Bedford marieth with the earle of saint Paules daughter.</div>

<p>In the meane time, the ladie Anne duchesse of Bedford departed this life at Paris,
by whose death the fast knot of faithful friendship betwixt the duke of Bedford and
his brother in law the duke of Burgognie began somewhat to slacken. Shortlie
after, to wit, about the beginning of the next yeare 1433, the said duke of Bedford
being thus a widower, through the persuason of the lord Lewes of Lutzenburgh
bishop of Terwine and Elie, and chancellor of France for king Henrie, agr&eacute;ed to
marrie the ladie Iaquet, daughter to Peter earle of saint Paule, and n&eacute;ece to the
said bishop, and to the lord Iohn of Lutzenburgh.</p>

<p>The mariage was solemnized at Terwine with great triumph. Which ended, the
duke with his new spouse (being about the age of seauent&eacute;ene yeares) came vnto
Calis, and so into England, from whence in the moneth of August next he returned
to Paris. The duke of Burgognie, though nothing pleased with this new aliance
contracted by the duke of Bedford, with the house of Lutzenburgh, but yet not able
to doo anie thing to let it; bicause of the mariage consummate yer he could find
any power or knowledge to hinder it. Whilest these things were a dooing, in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
places the French souldiers of the Dolphins, lacking wages (as the time serued) tooke
both Englishmen and Burgognians, ransoming and spoiling them at their pleasure.
Herewith the regent much mooued, prepared for warre after six moneths the truce
had b&eacute;ene taken: and so the warre againe was renewed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Frenchmen breake the peace and take the towne of Saint Valerie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Laignie besieged.</div>

<p>The Frenchmen anon as open truce-breakers, raised a crue, and suddenlie tooke
the towne of saint Valerie in Normandie, n&eacute;ere to the mouth of the riuer of Some.
An other armie, vnder the leading of sir Ambrose de Lore, wasted and destroied all
the countrie about Caen. The duke of Bedford on his part sent the earle of Arundell,
the earle of Warwikes sonne, the lord Lisle Adam marshall of France for king
Henrie, and twelue hundred men of warre with ordinance and munition to besiege
the town of Laignie vpon the riuer of Marne. The earle with shot of canon
brake the arch of the bridge, and got from the Frenchmen their bulworke, and set it
on fire. Diuerse assaults were attempted, but the towne was well defended: for
there were within it an eight hundred men of armes, besides other meane souldiers.</p>

<p>The duke of Bedford herewith gathered an armie of six thousand men, whereof were
capteins; Robert lord Willoughbie, sir Andrew Ogard chamberlaine to the duke, sir
Iohn Saluaine bailiffe of Rone, sir Iohn Montgomerie bailiffe of Caux, sir Philip
Hall bailiffe of Vernoill, sir Richard Ratcliffe deputie of Calis, sir Rafe Neuill, sir
Rafe Standish, sir Iohn Hanford, sir Richard Euthin, sir Richard Harington bailiffe
of Eureux, sir William Fulthorpe, sir Thomas Griffin of Ireland, Dauid Hall,
Thomas Stranguish, Leonard Ormstone esquiers, and Thomas Gerard. All gentlemen
of courage, and as forward to giue the French the foile, as the French for their
liues to giue them the discomfiture. But vnto which side the victorie should befall,
vncerteine it was before the triall of both their chances had determined the doubt
by the euent of the conflict.</p>

<p>The duke of Bedford furnished with this armie and companie of worthie capteins
came to the siege before Laignie, where he made a bridge of boats, and brought his
ordinance so n&eacute;ere the towne, that to all people it s&eacute;emed not long able to resist.
But the earle of Dunois, otherwise called the bastard of Orleance, with diuerse hardie
capteins, as valiantlie defended as the Englishmen assaulted. At length the French
king, perceiuing this towne to be the thr&eacute;e cornerd keie betw&eacute;ene the territories Burgognion,
English, and French, and the losse thereof should turne him to irreuocable
damage, sent the lord of Rieux, Poiton, the Hire, the lord Gawcourt, and six thousand
men, with great plentie of vittels, to the intent either to raise the siege, or else
to vittell the towne.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen made a brag, as though they would haue assailed the Englishmen
in their campe, but when they perceiued the courage of the lord regent, and the
desire he had to fight, they framed themselues so in order of battell, as though they
could doo all things, and yet in effect did nothing: but that whilest part of them
mainteined a skirmish, a sort of rude &amp; rusticall persons were appointed to conueie
into the towne thirtie oxen, and other small vittels. But this sw&eacute;et gaine was
d&eacute;erelie paied for, if the losse with the gaine be pondered in equall balance: for
hauing regard to their 30 leane oxen, in the skirmish were slaine the lord Saintreiles
brother to that valiant capteine Poiton de Saintreiles, also capteine Iohn brother to
the lord Gawcourt, and fiftie other noble and valiant personages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 11</div>

<p>The Frenchmen thus politiklie hauing doone their feat, in the beginning of August,
remooued their armie vnto Fort vnder Yer, where, by a bridge of tuns they passed
into the Ile of France. The duke of Bedford (like a wise prince) not minding to
leaue the more in ieopardie for hope of the lesse, nor the accident for the substance,
raised his siege, and returned to Paris, nothing more minding than to trie his
quarrell with dint of sword against the enimies, if they would thereto agr&eacute;e. And
herevpon sent Bedford his herald to the lord Gawcourt and other capteins of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
French armie, offering them battell and a pitched field within a conuenient time,
and where they would appoint. The French capteins answered the English herald,
that there was time to gaine, and time to lose: and for choise of times they would
vse their owne discretions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1433</div>

<div class="sidenote">The castell of Rone like to be taken by treason of the capteine.</div>

<p>Shortlie after, Piers Audebeufe constable of the castell of Rone, corrupted with
monie, suffered the marshall of France, with two hundred other, as persons disguised
to enter the place by stealth: but they were soone espied, and driuen to the
dungeon, where they were constrained to y&eacute;eld themselues prisoners: of the which
some were hanged, some headed, and some ransomed, at the pleasure of the regent.
This pageant thus plaied, the lord regent sent the earle of sainte Paule, and Robert
lord Willoughbie, with a competent number of men to besiege the town of S. Valerie,
which the Frenchmen a little before had taken. This siege continued the
space of thr&eacute;e w&eacute;eks; at the end whereof the Frenchmen within y&eacute;elded the towne,
and departed with their horsse and harnesse onelie to them saued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord of saint Paule deceassed.</div>

<p>The earle put there in garrison fresh and valiant souldiers, and appointed capteine
there, sir Iohn Aubemond. &para; In the same towne (whether by infection of aire, or
by corrupt vittels, which the townesmen did eat) a great pestilence shortlie after
happened, which consumed within a small time two parts of the people. The earle
of saint Paule, and the lord Willoughbie returning backe to the regent, were ioifullie
receiued, and within a while after, the earle departed from Paris to laie siege to the
castell of Mouchas. But being incamped n&eacute;ere the towne of Blangie, he by a sudden
maladie departed this life, the last of August, leauing his seigniories to Lewes
de Lutzenburg his sonne and heire. Bicause this dead earle was father in law to
the regent, solemne obsequies were kept for him both in Paris and in London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 12.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Prisoners killed.</div>

<p>In the meane season, the Frenchmen entering into high Burgognie, burnt, tooke,
and destroied diuerse townes; wherevpon the Burgognians assembled a great armie,
both to reuenge their quarrels, and to recouer their townes taken from them. To
whome as to his fr&eacute;ends the duke of Bedford sent the lord Willoughbie, and sir
Thomas Kiriell, with a conuenient number of souldiers, which entering into the
lands of Laonnois, were incountered with a great power of their enimies. But after
long fight, the Frenchmen were ouerthrowne, and of them left dead in the field an
hundred and sixtie horssemen, beside prisoners, which after vpon vrgent cause were
all killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1434.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Talbot saileth into France.</div>

<p>Whilest these things happened thus in France, Iohn lord Talbot gathered togither
a crue of chosen men of warre in England, to the number of eight hundred, and
sailed into Normandie, and passed by Rone to Paris. In his waie he tooke the strong
castell of Ioing betw&eacute;ene Beauuois and Gisours, and caused all the Frenchmen within
to be taken and hanged, and after raced and defaced the castell. After he had
rested himselfe a while at Paris, and taken aduise with the councell there, what
waie it should be best for him to take, without prolonging time; he with the lord
de Lisle Adam and others, departed from thence, hauing in their retinues sixt&eacute;ene
hundred men of warre. And comming to the castell of Beaumont vpon Oise,
whereof was capteine sir Amadour de Vignoils brother to the Hire, they found
it abandoned by them that had it in k&eacute;eping, who were withdrawne to the towne of
Creill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Talbot.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Earle of Arundell.</div>

<p>Thither therefore the lord Talbot followed, who slaieng in a skirmish the said
Amadour, he wan at length the said towne of Creill, and after the townes of Pont
S. Marence, Neufuile in Esmoie, la Rouge maison, Crespie in Valois, &amp; Cleremont
in Beauuois, and after with great riches and good prisoners returned to Paris. Neither
had the lord Talbot such good and prosperous successe alone but the earle of Arundell
also at the verie same season tooke the castell of Bomeline, &amp; raced it to the ground,
after he got by force the castell of Dorle, &amp; from thence came to S. Selerine, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the lord Ambrose de Lore, being capteine, issued out and fought with the Englishmen
so egerlie, that he droue them backe an arrow shoot by fine force: but the earle so
incouraged his men, that they gaue a fresh onset vpon the Frenchmen, and followed
it so fiercelie, that they slue a great number of them, and droue the residue into the
towne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Louiers besieged.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Saint Selerine won by assault.</div>

<p>After this victorie, he besieged Louiers, whereof was capteine the Hire, and his
brother, who rendered the towne without assault. Then the earle assembling togither
a great armie, returned againe to S. Selerine, &amp; inuironed the towne with a strong
siege. When he had lien there almost thr&eacute;e moneths, euerie daie attempting or dooing
somewhat, he finallie gaue so fierce an assault, that by force he entered the towne,
and slue Iohn Almaigne, and Guilliam saint Albine, the ch&eacute;efe capteins, and eight
hundred other men of warre. The children of le seigneur de Lore were taken
prisoners. The earle put new men of warre into the towne, and made capteine there
sir Iohn Cornewall. After this, he before the strong towne of Sillie pitched his
campe. The inhabitants terrified at the losse of saint Selerine, deliuered him pledges,
vpon condition, that if they were not rescued within thirtie daies next, then they
(their liues saued) should render the towne into his possession: which offer was receiued.</p>

<p>The French king, being aduertised hereof by a post, appointed (as some saie)
Arthur earle of Richmont (or as other write, Iohn duke of Alanson) with a great
companie of men of warre to go to the rescue of this towne. But whether it was the
earle or duke, certeine it is at his approching to the siege, he incamped himselfe by
a brooke side, ouer the which a man might haue striden, &amp; perceiuing how stronglie
the English were incamped against him, he thought it not for his profit to giue
battell; &amp; so in the night season raised &amp; went his waie without further attempt.
When they within the towne knew that their succours failed, they rendered
themselues to the mercie of the earle of Arundell, who gentlie receiued them, and
leauing a garrison in the towne, departed to Mans, and in his waie tooke the castels
of Mellaie and saint Laurence. About this time the lord Willoughbie &amp; sir Thomas
Kiriell, returning with great victorie out of Burgognie, passing by the towne of
Louiers, latelie reduced to the English obeisance, furnished it both with men and
munition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An insurrection in Normandie.</div>

<p>Among so manie good chances, some euill are accustomed to happen, or else the
gainers would not know themselues. And so at this time it happened, that a great
number of the common and rusticall people in Normandie dwelling by the sea coast,
either prouoked by the French king, or desirous of alteration and change (which
thing the commons much couet and desire) made an insurrection, put on harnesse, and
by force expelled certeine English garrisons out of their holds, publishing and proclaming
openlie, that their onelie purpose and intent was to expell and banish the whole
English nation out of their countries and coasts. Wherefore it maie be likelie, that
the blacke Morian will sooner become white, than the people bred in France will
heartilie loue an English borne. For it standeth not with their enuious nature to
alter their malicious maners; as the old prouerbe saith truelie of them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Celtica natura semper sequitur sua iura.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These rebels thus frantikelie assembled, with all sp&eacute;ed marched toward Caen, to
the intent there both to increase their number, and also to consult what waie they
should follow in their new begun enterprise. But the dukes of Yorke and Summerset,
then lieng in Normandie, hauing perfect knowledge hereof, immediatlie sent foorth
the earle of Arundell, and the lord Willoughbie with six thousand archers, and
thirt&eacute;ene hundred light horssemen, to staie and k&eacute;epe them from making anie further
progresse. The earle of Arundell appointed the lord Willoughbie, with two
thousand archers, and certeine horssemen to go afore him, and lie in a stale within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
some couert place. Which doone, the earle followed; &amp; so k&eacute;eping in the multitude
at the backe, droue them before him as deare into a buckestale: and when the
miserable wretches came n&eacute;ere to the stale, the earle made a token, whereat a gun
shot off for a signe. Therewith the lord Willoughbie set on them before, and the
earle behind, shooting so fiercelie, that the poore caitiues, wounded and galled with
the shot of arrowes, threw awaie their harnesse, and cried out instantlie for mercie.</p>

<p>The earle of Arundell mooued with compassion, caused his souldiers to staie from
further slaughter, and apprehending those that were knowen to be stirrers and leaders
of the rest, let the other returne home without further damage: but yet, yer the
souldiers could be brought backe vnder their standards, there were aboue a thousand
of the rebels slaine. And this commotion thus appeased, vpon inquirie of the principall
offenders, such as were found guiltie were put to terrible executions; as they
had well deserued. During which rebellion, Peter Rokeford and his companie gat by
treason the towne of Diepe and diuerse other holds thereto adioiming. After the earle
of Arundell had obteined so good successe in his enterprises (as partlie ye haue heard)
he attempted another, which was the last worke and finall labour of his liuing daies.
For the duke of Bedford, being informed that his aduersaries had gotten the towne of
Rue, and therein put a garrison, which sore vexed the countries of Ponthieu, Arthois,
and Bolennois, sent word to the earle that he without delaie should besiege the said
towne.</p>

<p>The earle obeieng his commandement assembled his people, and came to Gourneie,
where he heard tell how there was a castell n&eacute;ere to Beauuois called Gerberoie,
the which being fallen in decaie, Charles the French king had appointed sir Stephan
de Vignoils, commonlie called the Hire, to repare and newlie to fortifie, bicause it
stood commodiouslie to serue as a countergarrison against the English townes and
fortresses on those frontiers. The earle aduertised hereof, and perceiuing that this
new building would be greatlie preiudicial to the Englishmen, determined first to
dispossesse his enimies of that place, supposing to find small resistance: but he was
deceiued. For there was the said Hire, and thr&eacute;e thousand men of warre with him.
The erle comming thither, incamped himselfe with fiue hundred horssemen in a little
close not farre from the castell.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen, perceiuing that the earle and his horsses were wearie, and that his
archers were not yet come, determined to set vpon him before the comming of his
footmen, the which they knew to be little more than a mile behind. Wherfore for
a policie, they set foorth fiftie horssemen, as though there had b&eacute;ene no mo within the
castell. The earle perceiuing this, sent foorth sir Randolfe Standish to incounter
them, hauing with him an hundred horsses. The Frenchmen fought couragiouslie
awhile, and suddenlie came out all the remnant, and slue sir Randolfe Standish and all
his companie, and boldlie set on the earle and his band, which manfullie resisted the
Frenchmen, till at length the Hire caused thr&eacute;e culuerings to be shot off amongst the
Englishmen, wherof one strake the earle on the ancle, and so brake his leg, that for
paine he fell from his horsse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Arundell deceassed.</div>

<p>Then the Frenchmen entered amongst the Englishmen, tooke the earle lieng on the
ground, with sir Richard Wooduile, and six score more, and there were slaine almost
two hundred. The residue saued themselues as well as they might. The earle was
caried to Beauuois, where of his hurt he shortlie died, &amp; was buried in the frier
Minors. He was a man of singular vertue, constancie, and grauitie, whose death in
so troublous a season did sore appall the harts of the English people. Thus oftentimes
varied the chance of doubtfull warre, so that one time the Englishmen got by assault,
and y&eacute;elded diuerse strong townes, castels, and piles: and at another season the French
people, sometime by bargaine, sometime by assault, obteined the same againe, or other
in their st&eacute;ed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Bourbon dieth at London.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<p>About the moneth of Iune in this twelfth yeare, Iohn duke of Bourbon and Auuergne,
taken prisoner at the battell of Agincourt eight&eacute;ene y&eacute;eres past (as before ye
haue heard) now paieng his ransome, which was eight&eacute;ene thousand pounds sterling,
was taken with a most sore and grieuous feuer, the which made an end of his life in
the citie of London, on the same daie that was appointed for his departure towards
France, whose corpse was interred in the graie friers of the same citie. &para; This yeare
also about the latter end of Maie, was a m&eacute;eting appointed to be had at saint Omers
betwixt the dukes of Bedford and Burgognie, for the qualifieng of certeine displeasures
and grudges betwixt them kindled and mainteined by some flattering taletellers, who
raising matters of reproch touching their honors, bred such grudges, that all loue
betwixt them ceassed, all affinitie reiected, and all old fr&eacute;endship forgotten; such
enuie insueth where enimitie once hath princes harts possessed.</p>

<p>These two dukes come into the towne of saint Omers, the duke of Bedford being
then regent of France, sonne, brother, and vncle to kings, thought that the duke of
Burgognie should haue come and visited him in his lodging. The duke of Burgognie
on the other part, being lord and souereigne of the towne, iudged it as much vnm&eacute;et
for him to go to the regent where he was lodged. Howbeit by intreatie of fr&eacute;ends,
to m&eacute;et in a place indifferent betw&eacute;ene both their lodgings was appointed; which
offer not accepted, both parties departed discontent, and neuer after saw nor communed
togither. Thus by the proud disdaine and enuious discord of these two high
stomached princes, Bedford not minding to haue anie p&eacute;ere, and Burgognie not
willing to abide anie superior, shortlie after England much lost, and Burgognie
greatlie gained not, as by the sequeale may appeare.</p>

<p>The bastard of Orleance, called the earle of Dunois, the lord Rochford marshall

S. Denis by treason, skirmished with them of Paris, and leauing behind them a
great garrison, tooke the towne of Howdone, and Pont saint Marence by composition.
And at the same time was the towne of Pont Meulan taken by the sudden
scaling of two fishermen, who entered vp at a common priuie standing in the wall.
Thus warre continuallie lasted betwixt these two mightie nations, English and
French, within the realme of France (than which therefore no countrie thought more
miserable.) And though the poore people and inhabitants of the good townes and
villages, susteined most losse in their substance, yet the men of warre oftentimes
paied d&eacute;erest for the bargaine, being daily slaine, wounded, and taken prisoners; for
warre seldome beareth anie other fruit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1434.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Onophrius Panuinius.</i></div>

<p>[It may serue verie well here to recount, how somewhat before these daies, Martin
the fift, in the fift&eacute;enth yeare of his popedome, An. 1431, agr&eacute;eing vpon a generall
councell to be holden at Basill the same yeare, did anon after deceasse: whom Eugenie
the fourth succ&eacute;eding, and liking right well of the time and place, by his authority
signified and sent with Iulian Cesarine his legat, did confirme the choise.
Wherevpon as the councell the ninet&eacute;enth of Iulie the same 1431 was there begun,
and his holinesse soone after aduertised how malapertlie his ghostlie children had imbusied
themselues in checking at their holie fathers faults, and about reformation of
his church at Rome; his sublimitie therat highlie offended (for great cause it had)
commanded his legat by and by to dissolue that synod, and in his name to appoint
a new at Ferrar, and so come his waie: vnder colour forsooth how that place was
m&eacute;etest for the prelats of the Gr&eacute;eke church, who had to confer with the Latine
councell about points of religion, wherein they long had remained at square.</p>

<p>But these Basilien clerks, there still fastlie conteining themselues, so smallie regarded
this summons of Eugenie (who then with his prelats, as the time was run on,
vpon prorogation from Ferrar kept an other councell at Florence 1439) as by a confident
countermand cited Eugenie and all his cardinals to come to them at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
solemne set councell at Basill. Which his supremassie (for so best became it, notwithstanding
sundrie citations) vtterlie contemning to doo, they soone after like
verie impious imps, first for contumacie accurssed his holie fatherhood, then depriued
him of his papasie, and out of hand chose another in his office, one Amedius late
duke of Sauoie, who afore that time hauing giuen vp his possessions &amp; dignitie vnto
his children, became an heremite in a monasterie of his own building by mount Geuenna
in Sauoie nigh the lake Leman, where he by title of Decanus militum Iesu
Christi, and ten more of nobilitie with him, had setled themselues to liue.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An. 3. Nichol.</i></div>

<p>The vertuous minded man thus chosen pope by spirituall counsell inueigled, left
the holie life (such as it was) that he had profest, tooke the papasie vpon him the
same 1439, and called Felix the fift, which promotion yet he not long inioied. For
after, by his successour Nicholas the fifts ambition, that had suborned emperour
Frederike to be a worker in the matter, this sillie Amedius was coosined of his popes
golden crowne for a cardinalls felt hat. Then (good man) at last could he find,
whether were n&eacute;erer to christen profession, the life of a vertuous prince ruling in
iustice, of a solitarie heremite v&eacute;rtuouslie occupied, of an imperious pope that may
know no p&eacute;ere, or of a licentious cardinall to liue as he list. This poore prince
had experience of all, and then knew the best: when well might he lament him, but
too late repent him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1435</div>

<p>And in the fift yeare of this Basilien councell that had a continuance of eleuen
yeare (whereof an eight were run yer Felix was chosen, in which Eugenie remaining
pope still, though of curst hart he neuer came at them) motion was made
among Sigismund the emperour and other christen kings (who for appeasing this
schisme betw&eacute;ene the pope and his prelats, were all present by person or proxie) that
sith such horror of bloudshed betw&eacute;ene the two nations continuallie so lamentablie
raged in France, some mediation might be made for accord: whereof one thing s&eacute;emed
to minister occasion of the more hope, bicause the duke of Burgognie was willing
(so that it were not of his owne sute) to returne and reconcile himselfe with the
French king his mortall enimie and ancient aduersarie.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">A solemne tretie of peace at Arras.</div>

<p>H&eacute;erevpon by authoritie of this generall councell, two graue prelats, the one
Nicholas Albergat a Carthusian frier, intituled a pr&eacute;est cardinall of the holie crosse;
the other Hugh Lusignan a Cyprian, Gr&eacute;eke, bishop cardinall of Prenest in Italie, came
to the towne of Arras in Arthois, whither were sent from the king of England,
Henrie Beauford cardinall of Winchester, Henrie archbishop of Yorke, William de la
Poole earle of Suffolke, and Iohn Holland earle of Huntington, with diuerse other
knights and esquiers. And for the French king were there present Charles duke of
Bourbon, Lewes erle of Vandosme, Arthur of Britaine constable of France, the archbishop
of Reimes, and sir Philip Harecourt. The duke of Burgognie was there in
proper person, accompanied with the duke of Guelders, and the earles of Estampes,
Lignie, S. Paule, Vaudemont, Neures, and Daniell sonne to the prince of Orange,
with a great gard and a gallant companie.</p>

<p>Vpon the daie of the first session, the cardinall of S. Crosse declared to the thr&eacute;e
parties the innumerable misch&eacute;efes, that had followed to the whole state of the christian
common-wealth by their continual dissention and dailie discord, exhorting them
for the honour of God, &amp; for the loue which they ought to beare towards the aduancement of
his faith and true religion, to conforme themselues to reason, and to
laie aside all rancor, malice and displeasure; so that in concluding a godlie peace,
they might receiue profit and quietnesse h&eacute;ere in this world, and of God an euerlasting
reward in heauen. After this admonition, and diuerse daies of communication,
euerie partie brought in their demands, which were most contrarie, and farre
from anie likelihood of comming to a good conclusion.</p>

<p>The Englishmen would that king Charles should haue nothing but what it pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the king of England, and that not as dutie, but as a benefit by him of his m&eacute;ere
liberalitie giuen and distributed. The Frenchmen on the other part would that
K. Charles should haue the kingdome franklie and fr&eacute;elie, and that the king of England
should leaue the name, armes, and title of the king of France, and to be content
with the dukedomes of Aquitaine and Normandie, and to forsake Paris, and all
the townes which they possessed in France, betw&eacute;ene the riuers of Some and Loire,
being no parcell of the duchie of Normandie. To be br&eacute;efe, the demands of all
parts were betw&eacute;ene them so farre out of square, as hope of concord there was none
at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl.</i></div>

<p>The cardinals s&eacute;eing them so farre in sunder, minded not to dispute their titles,
but offered them reasonable conditions of truce and peace for a season, which notwithstanding,
either of frowardnesse, or of disdaine on both parts, were openlie refused.
Insomuch that the Englishmen in great displeasure, departed to Calis, and
so into England. &para; One writer affirmeth, that they being warned of a secret conspiracie
mooued against them, suddenlie departed from Arras, and so returned into their
countrie. But what cause soeuer hindered their accord and vnitie (sith this and that
may be surmized) certeine it is, that the onelie and principal cause was, for that the
God of peace and loue was not among them, without whom no discord is quenched,
no knot of concord fastened, no bond of peace confirmed, no distracted minds reconciled,
no true fr&eacute;endship mainteined: for had he b&eacute;ene among them, their dissenting
and waiward willes had sounded the sw&eacute;et harmonie of amiable peace, which of
all things that God hath bestowed vpon man is the verie best, and more to be set by
than manie triumphs, as the poet excellentlie well saith:</p>

<p>Now whiles this treatie of peace was in hand, the lord Talbot, the lord Willoughbie,
the lord Scales, with the lord Lisle Adam, and fiue thousand men of warre, besieged
the towne of saint Denis with a strong band. The earle of Dunois hearing
hereof, accompanied with the lord Lohac, and the lord Bueill, with a great companie
of horssemen hasted thitherwards to raise the siege, and by the waie incountred
with sir Thomas Kiriell, and Matthew <a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>Gough, riding also toward saint Denis, b&eacute;etw&eacute;ene
whom was a great conflict. But suddenlie came to the aid of the Frenchmen
the garrison of Pont Meulan, which caused the Englishmen to returne without
anie great harme or damage: sauing that Matthew <a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>Gough by foundering of his

<p>In the meane time was the towne of saint Denis rendered to the Englishmen, the
which raced the walles and fortifications, sauing the walles of the abbeie, and of the
tower called Venin. Shortlie after the towne of Pontois, where sir Iohn Ruppelleie
was capteine, rebelled; and by force the Englishmen were expelled, the inhabitants
y&eacute;elding themselues to the French king. This towne was small, but the losse was
great, bicause it was the keie that opened the passage betwixt the cities of Paris and
Rone. But now to returne to the communication at Arras, which after the departure
of the English commissioners held betwixt the Frenchmen and Burgognians, till at
length a peace was concluded, accorded, and sworne betwixt king Charles and duke
Philip of Burgognie, vpon certeine conditions, as in the French histories more plainlie
appeareth.</p>

<p>And after, the duke of Burgognie, to set a veile before the king of Englands eies,
sent Thoison Dore his ch&eacute;efe herald to king Henrie with letters, excusing the matter
by way of information, that he was constreined to enter in this league with K. Charles,
by the dailie outcries, complaints, and lamentations of his people; alledging against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>him, that he was the onlie cause of the long continuance of the wars, to the vtter
impouerishing of his owne people, and the whole nation of France. Therefore sith
he could not otherwise doo, but partlie to content his owne people, and ch&eacute;efelie to
satisfie the request of the whole generall councell, was in manner compelled for his
part to growe vnto a peace and amitie with king Charles.</p>

<p>He likewise wished that king Henrie, vpon reasonable and honorable conditions
of agr&eacute;ement offered, should in no wise refuse the same: whereby the long continued
warre at length might ceasse and take end, to the pleasure of almightie God,
which is the author of peace and vnitie: &amp; hereto he promised him his aid and furtherance,
with manie gaie words, which I passe ouer. The superscription of this
letter was thus [To the high and mightie prince, Henrie by the grace of God king
of England, his welbeloued cousine.] Neither naming him king of France, nor his
souereigne lord, according as (euer before that time) he was accustomed to doo. This
letter was much maruelled at of the councell, after they had throughlie considered
all the contents thereof, &amp; they could not but be much disquieted, so far foorth
that diuerse of them offended so much with the vntruth of the duke, that they could
not temper their passions, but openlie called him traitor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<p>But when the rumor of the dukes reuolting was published amongst the people,
they left words, and fell to bestowing of stripes: for being pricked with these euill
tidings, they ran in great outrage vpon all the Flemings, Hollanders, and Burgognions,
which then inhabited within the citie of London, and the suburbes of the same,
and slue and hurt a great number of them before they, by the kings proclamation,
could be staied from such iniurious dooing: for the king nothing more minded than
to saue innocent bloud, and to defend them that had not offended. The officer at
armes was willed to tell his maister, that it stood not with his honor to be enimie to
the English nation; and that his dutie had b&eacute;ene to k&eacute;epe his ancient truth and allegiance,
rather than to be occasion of new warre. And what a new reconciled enimie
was in respect of an old tried fr&eacute;end, he might shortlie find. [When the
messenger with this answer was dispatched, and vpon consultation found, a matter
standing both with good policie in forceing the proud subiect to know his obedience,
and also with great equitie to twitch a quareller with such pinsars as wherewith
afore he had nipt an other, so was it anon brought about, that sundrie of his good
townes and cities rebelled against him, whereby (lesse to his liking than to his
deseruing) he was verie well made to bite of a chokepeare of his own grafting.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">The death of the duke of Bedford regent of Fra&#x0304;ce.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A worthy saieng of a wise prince.</div>

<p>This yeare the fourt&eacute;eth daie of September died Iohn duke of Bedford, regent of
France, a man both politike in peace, and hardie in warre, and yet no more hardie
than mercifull when he had the victorie, whose bodie was with all funerall solemnitie
buried in the cathedrall church of our ladie in Rone, on the north side of the
high altar, vnder a sumptuous and costlie monument. Which toome when king
Lewes the eleauenth, by certeine vndiscr&eacute;et persons was counselled to deface, affirming
that it was a great dishonour both to the king and to the realme, to s&eacute;e the
enimie of his father and theirs to haue so solemne and rich a memorial: he answered
saieng, "What honour shall it be to vs, or to you, to breake this monument, and to
pull out of the ground the dead bones of him, whome in his life neither my father
nor your progenitors, with all their power, puissance, and fr&eacute;ends were once able to
to make fl&eacute;e one foot backward; but by his strengh, wit, and policie, kept them all
out of the principall dominions of the realme of France, and out of this noble and famous
duchie of Normandie? Wherefore I saie, first, God haue his soule, and let his bodie
now lie in rest, which when he was aliue, would haue disquieted the proudest of vs
all. And as for the toome, I assure you, it is not so decent nor conuenient, as his
honour and acts deserued, although it were much richer, and more beautifull."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorke made regent of France.</div>

<p>The frost was so extreame this yeare, beginning about the fiue and twentith daie
of Nouember, and continuing till the tenth of Februarie, that the ships with merchandize
arriuing at the Thames mouth, could not come vp the riuer: so their lading
there faine to be discharged, was brought to the citie by land. After the death of
that noble prince the duke of Bedford, the bright sunne in France toward Englishmen,
began to be cloudie, and dailie to darken, the Frenchmen began not onelie to
withdrawe their obedience by oth to the king of England, but also tooke sword in
hand &amp; openlie rebelled. Howbeit all these mishaps could not anie thing abash the
valiant courages of the English people: for they hauing no mistrust in God and good
fortune, set vp a new saile, began the warre afresh, and appointed for regent in
France, Richard duke of Yorke, sonne to Richard earle of Cambridge.</p>

<p>Although the duke of Yorke was worthie (both for birth and courage) of this honor
and preferment, yet so disdeined of Edmund duke of Summerset being cousine to
the king, that by all means possible he sought his hindrance, as one glad of his
losse, and sorie of his well dooing: by reason whereof, yer the duke of Yorke could
get his dispatch, Paris and diuerse other of the ch&eacute;efest places in France were gotten
by the French king. The duke of Yorke perceiuing his euill will, openlie dissembled
that which he inwardlie minded, either of them working things to the others displeasure,
till through malice &amp; diuision betw&eacute;ene them, at length by mortall warre
they were both consumed, with almost all their whole liues and ofspring.</p>

<p>The Normans of the countrie of Caux, being heartened by the death of the
duke of Bedford, began a new rebellion, slue diuerse Englishmen, robbed manie
townes that were vnder the English obeisance, and tooke the towne of Harflue by
assault, and diuerse other townes. But the lord regent being aduertised, sent foorth
the lord Scales, sir Thomas Kiriell, and the lord Hoo, which so afflicted those rebels
of Caux, that they slue aboue fiue thousand persons, and burnt all the townes and
villages in the countrie, not being walled: so that in that part was neither habitation
nor tillage, for all the people fled into Britaine, and all the beasts of the
countrie were brought to Caudebecke, where a good sh&eacute;epe was sold for an English
penie, and a cow for twelue pence. Dailie was skirmishing and fighting in euerie
part, in so much that the lord Scales at the Rie beside Rone, discomfited the Hire,
and fift&eacute;ene hundred valiant Frenchmen; of the which, aboue thr&eacute;e hundred were
taken prisoners, beside the gaine of seauen faire coursers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">S&eacute;e before pag. 129.</div>

<p>Amongst other of the prisoners, were sir Richard Reginald de Fountaines, sir Alain
Gerond, Alain Monsaie, and Geffrie Grame, capteine of the Scots. But yet this
victorie and others the like, staied not the Frenchmen from working treason dailie,
insomuch that diuers townes turned to the part of K. Charles, and some were taken
by practise, as Diepe, Bois, Vincennes, and others. &para; So that here partlie was accomplished
the prophesie of Henrie the fift, giuen out in the ninth yeare of his
reigne when he laie at siege before Meaux, that Henrie of Windsore should loose all
that Henrie of Monmouth had gotten (for so they are named according to the place
of their natiuitie) and this prediction was complet and full by that time the yeares of
his regiment were expired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1436</div>

<p>But h&eacute;ere is one ch&eacute;efe point to be noted, that either the disdeine amongest the
ch&eacute;ef p&eacute;eres of the realme of England (as y&eacute;e haue heard) or the negligence of
the kings councell (which did not fores&eacute;e dangers to come) was the losse of the
whole dominion of France, betw&eacute;ene the riuers of Seine and Marne, and in especiall,
of the noble citie of Paris. For where before, there were sent ouer thousands for
defense of the holds and fortresses, now were sent hundreds, yea and scores, some
rascals, and some not able to draw a bowe, or carrie a bill: for the lord Willoughbie,
and the bishop of Terwine, which had the gouernance of the great citie of Paris,
had in their companie not two thousand Englishmen.</p>

<p>Which weakenesse king Charles well perceiued, and therefore by authentic appoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>ed
the constable, Arthur of Britaine, the earle of Dunois, the lords de la Roch, and
Lisle Adam, with other valiant capteins and men of warre, as well Burgognions as
French, to go before Paris, trusting by fauour of certeine citizens, with whome he
had intelligence, shortlie to be lord of the citie, without great losse or battell. So
these capteins came before the citie of Paris. But perceiuing that all things succ&eacute;eded
not according to their expectation, they returned to Mont Martyr, and the next
daie suddenlie set on the towne of saint Denis, and constreined the Englishmen that
kept it, to fl&eacute;e into the abbeie, and into the tower Venin. In this conflict two
hundred Englishmen were slaine, the residue vpon reasonable composition rendered vp
the place, and departed to Paris.</p>

<p>Thomas lord Beaumont, who of late was come to Paris with eight hundred men,
issued foorth with six hundred souldiers, intending to view the dooings and number of
the French armie; but suddenlie compassed about, within a small space was discomfited
and taken, with him fourescore prisoners, beside two hundred slaine in the field,
the remnant chased to the verie gates of the citie. The Parisiens, and especiallie the
maister of the halles, and some of the vniuersitie, and Michaell Lallier, and manie
notable burgesses of the citie (who euer with an English countenance couered a French
hart) perceiuing the weaknesse of the Englishmen, and force of the French; signified
to the French capteins their toward minds willing them with all diligence to come &amp;
receiue so rich a preie without anie difficultie, readie to be giuen and deliuered into
their hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The treson of the Parisiens.</div>

<p>The constable delaieng no time, came with his power, lodged by the charter house:
and the lord Lisle Adam, approching to the walles, shewed to the citizens a charter,
sealed with the great seale of king Charles, by the which he had pardoned them their
offenses, and granted to them all their old liberties, and ancient priuileges, so that
they would hereafter be to him true and obedient: which thing to them declared,
they ran about the towne, crieng; S. Denis, liue king Charles. The Englishmen
perceiuing this, determined to k&eacute;epe the gate S. Denis, but they were deceiued: for
the cheines were drawne in euerie str&eacute;et, and women and children cast downe stones
and scalding water on the Englishmens heads, and the citizens in armour fought with
them and chased them from str&eacute;et to str&eacute;et, and from lane to lane, and slue and hurt
diuerse and manie of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paris y&eacute;elded to the French king.</div>

<p>The bishop of Terwine, chancellor there for king Henrie, the lord Willoughbie, and
sir Simon Morhier, tooke great paine to appease the people: but when they saw that
all auailed not, they withdrew into the bastile of saint Anthonie, which fortresse they
had well vittelled, and furnished with men and munitions. Whilest this rumor was
in the towne, the earle of Dunois and others scaled the walles, and some passed the
riuer by botes, and opened gate of saint Iames, by the which the constable with his
banner displaied, entered, at whose entrie the Parisiens made great ioy. The bishop
and the lord Willoughbie, with their small companie, defended their fortresse ten daies,
looking for aid: but when they saw that no comfort appeared, they y&eacute;elded their fortresse,
so that they and theirs, with certeine baggage, might peaceablie returne to Rone.
Thus was the citie of Paris brought into the possession of Charles the French king,
through the vntrue demeanour of the citizens, who contrarie to their oths, and
promised allegiance, like false and inconstant people, so reuolted from the English.</p>

<p>After this glorious gaine, the Frenchmen besieged the towne of Craill vpon Oise,
wherof sir William Chamberlaine was capteine, the which with fiue hundred Englishmen
issued out of the towne, and after long fight, discomfited his enimies, &amp; slue
two hundred, and tooke a great number prisoners: the remnant not liking the market
departed to Campaigne, and other townes adioining. During which season, twelue
burgesses of the towne of Gisours sold it for monie vnto Poiton de Xantrailes. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
he had not the castell deliuered, &amp; therefore with all his power he besieged the same;
whereof the lord Talbot being aduertised, sent for the lord Scales, and they both with
eight&eacute;ene hundred men rescued the castell, tooke the towne, and discomfited their
enimies, and slue of them foure hundred persons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke se&#x0304;t into France too late.</div>

<p>Now according to the old saieng (when the st&eacute;ed is stolen shut the stable doore)
the duke of Yorke appointed at the last parlement to be regent of France (after that
Paris, Saint Denis, Saint Germans in Laie, and diuerse other townes in France were
taken and betraied for lacke of conuenient succours) was sent ouer into Normandie
with eight thousand men, and in his companie, the earles of Salisburie, and Suffolke,
and the lord Fawconbridge, and diuerse other valiant capteins. When he was landed,
the earle of Salisburie besieged the castell of Chambois which shortlie was to him
rendered. Then the duke remooued to Rone, where he set good orders, and did great
iustice to the countrie; wherefore the Normans in their chronicles highlie extoll him
for that point. Howbeit they saie, that he gat by long siege the towne and abbeie
of Fecampe, and did none other notable act, during the time of his rule and gouernment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Burgognie prepareth an armie against Calis.</div>

<p>In this fourt&eacute;enth yeare, the duke of Burgognie determined by the aduise of his
councell, to attempt the winning of Calis. The prouision was woonderous great
which was made for the atchiuing of this enterprise: whereof sir Iohn Ratcliffe,
deputie of the towne of Calis, hauing perfect intelligence, aduertised king Henrie,
and his councell, who incontinentlie sent thither the earle of Mortaigne, sonne to
the duke of Summerset, and the lord Camois, with fift&eacute;ene hundred men, and great
foison of vittels, that issued out of Calis, and came before Grauelin, where they were
incountered with a great number of Flemings, who were shortlie discomfited, foure
hundred of them slaine, and six score taken prisoners. Within two daies after, the
Englishmen draue by fine force the lords of Warren and Bado to the barriers of Ard,
and discomfited their whole companie, to the number of fift&eacute;ene hundred, slue seauen
valiant capteins, and tooke manie gentlemen prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Duke of Burgognie with fortie thousand me&#x0304;.</div>

<p>The duke of Burgognie, remaining still in his former purpose, assembled togither,
of Flemings, Picards, Hollanders, and Heneweirs, a great armie, to the number of
fortie thousand, so well armed, so well vitteled, so well furnished with ordinance,
and garnished in all things, that they thought and blazed amongst themselues, that
the Calisians would leaue their towne desolate, and fl&eacute;e for their safegard, hearing
onelie of the dukes approch: but they reckoned without their host; and so paid a
d&eacute;erer shot than they looked for. Now when this mightie armie was past the water
of Grauelin, the duke intending to begin his feats, assaulted the little poore castell
of Oie, which hauing in it but fiftie souldiers, whereof twelue sold their liues d&eacute;erelie;
the remnant (compelled by necessitie) y&eacute;elded themselues to the dukes mercie.
Which to please the Gantois (being of number most puissant in all the armie)
liberallie gaue to them, both the castell and prisoners, who (rude and cruell people)
not onelie raced the castell but also hanged nine and twentie of the captiues, and
had so doone with the residue, if the duke, offended at their crueltie, had not willed
a staie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Calis besieged by the Duke of Burgognie.</div>

<p>After this feat doone, the Picards besieged the castell of Marke, and gaue thr&eacute;e
assaults to it. The Englishmen within, being in number two hundred and six,
vnder the gouernement of their capteine sir Iohn Gedding, valiantlie defended the
place; vntill at length, despairing of succours, they y&eacute;elded themselues (their liues
and lims saued.) The castell of Marke being thus deliuered, was raced to the
ground. Then the duke, accompanied with the duke of Cleues, the earle of Estampes,
the lords of Dantoing, Croie, Crisquie, Humiers, and manie other barons and
knights, with his great armie, came before Calis, &amp; placed his siege about the same
most to his aduantage: he gaue thr&eacute;e assaults, and gained nothing by them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
constreined to k&eacute;epe them further off. At the first assault, the Hire which was come
to s&eacute;e the duke of Burgognie, was sore wounded and hurt. A cooling card it was also
vnto them, still to s&eacute;e ships arriued in the hauen out of England, openlie before their
faces, laden with vittels, munition and men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dukes enterprise to bar the hauen.</div>

<p>The duke on a daie riding about to view the situation of the towne, to the intent
to take his most aduantage (either by assault or otherwise) was quickelie espied, and
with the shot of a canon, a trumpetter, which rode next before him, and thr&eacute;e horsses
in his companie were slaine out of hand. The lord of Croie, and a conuenient
number with him, was appointed to besiege the castell of Guisnes, where he got
little profit, and did lesse harme. Moreouer, for the better aduancing of his enterprise,
the duke minded to stop vp the hauen; so that no succours should enter there.
Herevpon, he caused foure great hulkes to be fraught with great square stones, cemented
and ioined togither with lead, to the intent they should lie still like a mount, and
not seuer in sunder.</p>

<p>These ships, with the residue of the dukes nauie, were conueied into the mouth of
Calis hauen, and at a full sea, by craft and policie, were soonke downe to the ground.
But whether God would not that the hauen should be destroied, either the conueiers
of the hulkes knew not the verie chanell; these foure great ships, at the low water,
laie openlie vpon the sands, without hurting the rode or chanell. Which when the
souldiers perceiued, they issued out of the towne, brake the ships, and caried both
the stones and timber into the towne. An other deuise the duke had, which was the
building of a strong bastile vpon a little mountaine, which he furnished with foure
hundred men, and much artillerie, that did impeach the Englishmen from issuing foorth
of the towne, to their great displeasure.</p>

<p>Whilest these things were adooing, there came to the duke an herald called Penbroke,
belonging to duke of Glocester, who declared to the duke of Burgognie, that
the protector of England his maister (if God would send him wind &amp; weather) would
giue him battell, either there, or in anie other place within his owne countrie, where
he would appoint, and that with sp&eacute;ed, if God vouchsafed him wind and weather.
The duke answered the herald; "Sir, saie to your maister, that his chalenge is both
honorable and reasonable: howbeit, he shall not n&eacute;ed to take the paines to s&eacute;eke me
in mine owne countrie, for (God willing) he shall find me h&eacute;ere, till I haue my will of
the towne, readie to abide him and all the power he can bring." After the herald
had receiued this answer, he was highlie ch&eacute;ered, and had a cup and an hundred
guildens to him giuen in reward, and so he returned to Calis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dukes bastile woone.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Burgognie breaketh vp the siege before Calis, and fl&eacute;eth, the 26 of Iulie.</div>

<p>After whose departure, the duke called a councell in the ch&eacute;efe pauilion of the
Gantois, about this message of the English herald, where it was determined with
great courage, that they would abide the battell, if the duke of Glocester came to
offer it. Whilest this great matter was in consultation, the Calisians, not well content
with the bastile which the duke had newlie builded, issued out of the towne in great
number, part on horssebacke and part on foot. The footmen ran to assault the bastile,
and the horssemen went betw&eacute;ene the armie &amp; the assailants, to stop the aid and succours
that might come. Vpon the sounding of the alarme, the duke himselfe in person
was comming on foot, to rel&eacute;eue his men: but being kept backe a space by the English
horssemen, in that delaie of time, the bastile was woone by fine force, and eight
score persons of those that kept it slaine, beside the residue which were taken prisoners,
and led to Calis with all the ordinance and artillerie, to the high displeasure of the
duke and his prudent councell. The next daie after, there sprang a rumor in the armie
(no man could tell how) that the duke of Glocester with a great puissance was alreadie
imbarked, and would arriue at the next tide. The same night the duke fled awaie,
and sent in all hast to the lord of Croie, to raise his siege before Guisnes, which tidings
were to him verie ioious, for he neither got nor saued. So these two capteins de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>parted,
leauing behind them, both ordinance, vittels, &amp; great riches. &para; The French
writers (to saue the honor of the duke of Burgognie) saie, that there was a certeine
discord and commotion amongst the Flemings and Duch nation, affirming,
that the great lords and the Picards (whome the Frenchmen greatlie extoll) would
betraie and sell the Flemings and their fr&eacute;ends, and that for the same cause in a great
furie they cried; Home, home: and would not tarrie for anie request that the duke
could make, and so by their misgouernance, the duke was inforced to raise his siege,
and to depart. The Flemish authors affirme the contrarie, saieng, that they were
readie to abide the comming of the duke of Glocester: but the duke of Burgognie
fearing to be intrapped betw&eacute;ene the English armie without, and the garrison within
the towne of Calis, fled awaie in the night, giuing to them no warning thereof before,
so that for lacke of time, and conuenient space to lade and carrie their stuffe, and
being commanded vpon the sudden to dislodge with all sp&eacute;ed, they left behind them
their vittels, tents, and other things, to their great losse and detriment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A gun called Digeon.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Glocester spoileth Flanders.</div>

<p>Howsoeuer the matter was, the truth is, that he fled the six and twentith daie of
Iulie, in the night. And the next daie in the morning, the duke of Glocester landed
in Calis hauen, &amp; streight went into the campe, where his enimies the night before
were lodged, and there he found manie faire p&eacute;eces of ordinance, and speciallie one
called Digeon: so named, after the ch&eacute;efe towne of Burgognie; beside pauilions, wine,
b&eacute;ere, meale, and innumerable vittels. The duke of Glocester, s&eacute;eing his enimies
reculed, hauing in his companie fiue and twentie thousand men, entered into Flanders,
burning houses, killing such as made resistance, destroieng the countrie on
euerie part, setting fire in the townes of Poperinch, Bailleull, and others. Also,
they wasted the suburbes of diuerse closed townes, and after passed by Newcastell,
Rimesture, and Valon chapell: and then entering into Artois, they came to Arques and
Blandesques, setting fire in euerie part where they came. Thus they passed by saint
Omers, and finallie by Arde returned to Guisnes: and so to Calis at the six w&eacute;eks
end, with great booties of cattell and riches.</p>

<p>In all this their iournie, they had but small store of bread, which caused much

of the enimies sword: and yet the Flemings write, that they of Bruges distressed to
the number of two thousand Englishmen in this iournie. Howbeit, the French
writers affirme, that the Englishmen lost more of their companie in the marches about
Ard, than they did in all other places where they had b&eacute;ene before, hauing passed
through the parties of Flanders, without incounter, or any damage doone to them by
the enimies. After that, the duke of Glocester returned into England, where he
was aduertised, that Iames king of Scots had besieged the castell of Rockesburgh
with thirtie thousand men: but the capteine thereof, sir Rafe Greie defended it so
manfullie, for the space of twentie daies, that king Iames being then aduertised,
that the earle of Northumberland was comming to fight with him, fled with no lesse
losse than dishonor, and inough of both.</p>

<p>Shortlie after that the duke of Burgognie had b&eacute;ene before Calis, at the desire of
princes, a truce for a time was moued to be had betw&eacute;ene the king of England &amp; the
said duke. For which cause were sent to Grauelin for the king of England, Henrie
Beauford cardinall of Winchester, Iohn lord Mowbraie duke of Northfolke, Humfrie
earle of Stafford, and diuerse other well learned &amp; honorable personages. And for the
duke of Burgognie, there appeared the duchesse his wife, the bishop of Arras, the
lord of Croie, and diuerse other. At this treatie, a truce was taken for a small time,
and for a lesse obserued, which was concluded betw&eacute;ene the king of England, and
the duchesse of Burgognie (interlacing the duke and his name.)</p>

princes sometime with such vaine glosses and scornefull expositions will hide their
dooings, and cloke their purposes; to the intent they would not either be espied, or
else that they may plucke their heads out of the collar at their pleasure. But (as
the common opinion goeth) he which is a promise-breaker escapeth not alwaies with
impunitie. For it is well s&eacute;ene by dailie and vsuall euents both in princes and priuat
persons, that for violating their faith, and breaking of promise, manie discommodities
arise, and inconueniences not a few doo follow. To the due k&eacute;eping whereof the

preferreth it before sacrifice, the sentence is of great excellencie out of a pagans

<p>About this season, qu&eacute;ene Katharine mother to the king of England departed out
of this life, and was buried by hir husband in the abbeie of Westminster. This
woman, after the death of king Henrie the fift hir husband, being yoong and lustie,
following more hir owne wanton appetite than fr&eacute;endlie counsell, and regarding more
priuate affection than princelike honour, tooke to husband priuilie a galant gentleman
and a right beautifull person, indued with manie goodlie gifts both of bodie &amp; mind,
called Owen Teuther, a man descended of the noble linage and ancient line of Cadwallader
last king of the Britains. By this Owen she brought foorth thr&eacute;e goodlie
sonnes, Edmund, Iasper, and another that was a monke in Westminster and liued a
small time: also a daughter which in hir youth departed out of this transitorie life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ab. Fl.</i></div>

<p>King Henrie, after the death of his mother, bicause, they were his brethren of one

Edmund of Margaret daughter and sole heire to Iohn duke of Summerset begat Henrie,
who after was king of this realme, called Henrie the seuenth, of whome ye shall heare
more in place conuenient. This Owen, after the death of the qu&eacute;ene his wife, was
apprehended and committed to ward, bicause that (contrarie to the statute made in the
sixt yeare of this king) he presumptuouslie had maried the qu&eacute;ene, without the kings
especiall assent, out of which prison he escaped, and let out other with him, but was
againe apprehended, and after escaped againe. &para; Polychronicon saith that he was a
squier of low birth and like degr&eacute;e, the same author also reporteth that he was commanded
to Newgate by the duke of Glocester then lord protector of the realme: out
of which prison he brake by the helpe of a pr&eacute;est that was his chapline. Neuerthelesse
he was apprehended afterwards by the lord Beaumont, &amp; brought againe to Newgate,
whence (when he had remained there a while) he was deliuered and set at libertie.</p>

and the earle hir brother. This sir Richard was made baron of Riuers, and after
earle, and had by this ladie manie noble sonnes, and faire daughters, of the which one
was the ladie Elizabeth, after qu&eacute;ene of England, by reason she was married vnto

Robert with him, and a six hundred good fighting men. The assailants cast trenches
and so fortified themselues in their campe and lodgings, that when the earles of Ew

<p>The capteins within the towne perceiuing they could not be aided, did shortlie

k&eacute;eping of Thomas Paulet, William Limbrike, Christopher Barber, and George saint
George, which manie yeares (till the diuision began in England) manfullie and valiantlie
defended both the towne and the hauen. But afterward, when this duke of
Summerset was regent and gouernour of Normandie, he not onlie lost this towne of
Harflue, but also the citie of Rone, and the whole duchie of Normandie, whereas
now (being but a deputie) he got it to his high praise and glorie. In this yeare was
Iames king of Scots murthered by certeine traitors of his own subiects [euen in his

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Warwike made regent of France.</div>

<p>The lord Talbot besieged Tankeruile, and after foure moneths had it simplie to
him rendered. This towne was no great gaine to the Englishmen, for in the meane
season, the French king in his owne person besieged the strong towne of Monstreau
fault Yonne; whereof Thomas Gerard being capteine, more for desire of reward,
than for feare of enimies, sold the towne to the French king, and had of him great
gifts and interteinement, as afterwards was openlie knowen. This towne had b&eacute;ene
rescued of the French king fought withall, if one chance had not happened. For the
duke of Yorke about that time was discharged of his office, and the earle of Warwike
preferred to the same, so that the duke of Yorke, lieng as then at Rone, would haue
gladlie rescued the towne, if his authoritie had not surceassed; and the earle of Warwike
could not come in time, for the wind was contrarie to him.</p>

<p>This present yeare was a parlement holden at Westminster, in the which manie good
and profitable acts for the preseruation of concord at home, and defense against the
enimies abroad, were ordeined and deuised. &para; Arthur of Britaine constable of France,
and Iohn duke of Alanson, were sent by the French king into Normandie, with a
great armie, to besiege the towne of Auranches, standing vpon the knob of an hill:
where after they had laien a certeine space without gaine, the lord Talbot with a valiant
companie of men came thither, and offered the enimies battell. Which when
they at all hands refused, the lord Talbot perceiuing their faint harts, raised his field,
and in the open sight of them all, entered into the towne, and the next daie issued out;
and finding the Frenchmen riding abroad to destroie the plaine countrie, he compassed
them about, and slue manie of them, and tooke diuerse prisoners. Although the
Frenchmen got neither honor nor profit by this iournie, yet they enterprised a greater
matter, as the winning of Rone; in so much that Pouton de Santreils, and the Hire,
with manie other notable capteins, hauing promise of certeine burgesses of that citie
to haue entrie made them, secretlie in the night came forward to a towne called Rise
or Riz, not past foure leagues from Rone, and there lodged.</p>

<p>The lord Talbot, the lord Scales, and sir Thomas Kiriell hearing of their approch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>set out of Rone at midnight, &amp; with great paine came to Rise so couertlie in the
morning, that the French suddenlie surprised and set vpon, like men all amazed ran
awaie and fled. In the chase were taken the lord of Fontains, sir Aleine Geron, sir
Lewes de Balle, and thr&eacute;escore knights, and esquiers, beside others; and there were
slaine two hundred and more. The Hire escaped verie narrowlie, by swiftnesse of his
horsse, though not vnwounded. The Englishmen returned to the towne of Rise, and
found there great number of horsses &amp; other baggages, which they ioiouslie brought
with them to Rone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Warwike regent came into France.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Croitoy besieged by the duke of Burgognie.</div>

<p>On the sixt daie of Nouember this present yeare, the earle of Warwike, as regent
of France, passed the sea, after he had b&eacute;ene seuen times shipped and vnshipped, and
landed at Homflue with a thousand fresh souldiers, and came to Rone, and then the
duke of Yorke returned into England. Betw&eacute;ene the change of these two capteins,
the duke of Burgognie (which sore enuied the glorie of the Englishmen) besieged the
towne of Crotoy, with ten thousand men and more, hauing with him great plentie of
guns and goodlie ordinance. The earle of Warwike aduertised hereof, sent the lord
Fauconbridge, sir Thomas Kiriell, sir Iohn Montgomerie, Thomas Limbrike, Thomas
Chandois, Dauid Hall, and diuerse other knights and esquiers, and an host of fiue thousand
men, which passed the riuer of Some, beside the towne of saint Valerie, wading in
the water vp to the chin, so glad were they to rescue their felowes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Croitoy rescued.</div>

<p>When the duke of Burgognie was informed of the approching of the lord Talbot,
he with all his power (sauing foure hundred, which were left in a bastile by him there
newlie builded) fled to Abuile, the bastile was soone gained by the Englishmen, and
those within either slaine or taken. After this, the lord Talbot sent to the duke of
Burgognie, signifieng that except he would come foorth, and bide by a battell, he
would vtterlie wast his countrie of Picardie. According wherevnto (the duke of
Burgognie shrinking) he burnt townes, spoiled and slue manie people in Picardie.
But for all those his doings, the duke of Burgognie appeared not, but got him from
Abuile to Amiens, so that the lord Talbot abode twentie daies full in Picardie and
Arthois, destroieng all afore him, and after returned vntouched. In the meane season,
sir Thomas Kiriell had gotten all the dukes cariages and ordinance, and left as much
vittell in the towne of Croitoy, as would serue six hundred men a whole yeare, and
conueied the residue to the earle of Warwike, who highlie praised them for their hardie
dooings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1438</div>

<p>After this, Henrie earle of Mortaigne, sonne to Edmund duke of Summerset, ariued
at Chierburgh with foure hundred archers, &amp; thr&eacute;e hundred speares, and passed through
Normandie, till he came into the countie of Maine, where he besieged a castell called
saint Anian, in the which were thr&eacute;e hundred Scots, besides Frenchmen. This castell
he tooke by assault, slue the Scots, and hanged the Frenchmen, bicause they were
once sworne English. After this he got also another castell, two miles from saint
Iulians, called Alegerche, which was shortlie after recouered; and the lord of Camewis,
which came to the rescue of the same, in the meane waie was intrapped and taken.
Thus flowed the victorie, sometime on the one partie, and sometime on the other.
For about the same time the townes of Meaux in Brie, and saint Susan were sold and
deliuered to the French part, by the vntruth of the burgesses and inhabitants of the
same towns, about the latter end of this sixt&eacute;enth yeare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A feat of a politike capteine &amp; wise councellor.</div>

<p>In the moneth of Iune, the earle of Huntington (as Steward of Guien) with two
thousand archers, and foure hundred speares was sent into Gascoigne, as a supplie to
the countrie and co&#x0304;mons of the same: for the king of England and his councell were
informed, that the earle of Dunois laie in the frontiers of Tholouse secretlie, by rewards
and faire promises practising to procure diuerse townes in Guien to become French.
Wherefore this earle (like a politike warrior) altered not onelie the capteins in euerie
towne and citie, but also remoued the magistrates, and changed the officers from
towne to towne, and roome to roome; so that by this meanes, the earle of Dunois at
that time lost both trauell and cost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two shrewd persuaders.</div>

<p>In the same moneth also, sir Richard Wooduile, sir William Chamberleine, sir
William Peito, and sir William Storie, with a thousand men, were sent to stuffe the
townes in Normandie, which at that time had therof great n&eacute;ed: for the English
capteins had small confidence in the Normans, and not too much in some of their own
nation. For that harlot briberie, with hir fellow couetousnesse, ran so fast abroad
with French crownes, that hard was it to remaine vncorrupted. In this yeare, the
Dolphin of France alied with Iohn duke of Alanson and Iohn duke of Burgognie,
rebelled against his father king Charles: but in the end, by wise persuasions, and
wittie handling of the matter, the knot of that seditious faction was dissolued, and
the king with his sonne, and the other confederates openlie and apparantlie pacified.
The Englishmen taking aduantage of this domesticall diuision in France, raised an
armie, and recouered againe diuerse townes, which had b&eacute;ene surprised from them
before, and prepared also to haue recouered the citie of Paris, till they hard of the

<p>In Nouember of this yeare, there was such a great frost, and after that so d&eacute;epe a

wether put the Englishmen in hope to recouer againe the towne of Ponthoise, by
the French king gotten before, by corrupting with monie diuerse burgesses of the
towne. Hervpon the Englishmen clothed all in white, with Iohn lord Clifford their
capteine, came in the night to the diches, passed them without danger by reason of
the frost, scaled the walles, slue the watch, and tooke the towne, with manie profitable
prisoners. &para; After the regaining of this towne, the lord Richard Beauchampe
earle of Warwike died in the castell of Rone, from whence conueied into England,
he was with solemne ceremonies buried at his college of Warwike, in a verie faire and
sumptuous sepulchre.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Enguerant.</i></div>

<p>About the beginning of Lent, the duke of Summerset, and the lord Talbot, with
other capteins and men of warre to the number of two thousand, which they had
assembled in the marches of Normandie towards Rone, marching forward towards
Picardie, passed ouer the riuer of Seine; and through the towne of Monteruell, came
before the fortresse of Folleuile, which the duke besieged, whilest the lord Talbot
entered further into the countrie. After that the duke had mounted his great artillerie,
and began to batter the hold, the capteine within chanced to be slaine with a
shot of the same artillerie, &amp; shortlie after, the batterie being still continued, the rest
of the men of warre that serued vnder him y&eacute;elded the place, in which the duke left
a competent garrison of souldiers, which afterwards sore indamaged the countrie.</p>

<p>This doone, the duke followed the lord Talbot, who was alreadie entered a good
waie within the countrie of Santhois, and now ioining their powers togither, they
came to a fortresse called Lihons in Santhois, which was also rendered vnto them,
after they had burnt the church; which the countrie people kept against them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
would not y&eacute;eld it, till they were fired out, burnt, and slaine; to the number of

the duke with his power laie there about ten daies, sending diuerse troops of his men
of warre abroad into the countrie, which spoiled the same, tooke the fortresse of
Herbonneres, and the lord thereof within it, who for his ransome, and to haue his

<div class="sidenote">Ponthoise besieged by the French king, but valiantlie defended.</div>

<p>After the death of the earle of Warwike, the duke of Yorke was againe made regent of
France, which accompanied with the earle of Oxenford, the lord Bourchier called earle
of Ewe, sir Iames of Ormond, the lord Clinton, sir Richard Wooduile, &amp; diuerse
other noble men, sailed into Normandie. Before whose ariuall, the French king sore
gr&eacute;eued with the taking of the towne of Ponthoise, assembled a great armie, and
besieged the said towne himselfe in person, inuironing it with bastiles, trenches, and
ditches, beating the walles and bulworks with shot of great ordinance, and giuing
therevnto diuerse great and fierce assaults. But Iohn lord Clifford, like a valiant
capteine, defended the towne so manfullie, that the Frenchmen rather lost than
woone.</p>

<p>The duke of Yorke at his landing receiued true aduertisement of this siege, wherevpon
he sent for the lord Talbot, and a great number of soldiers, and so came n&eacute;ere
to the towne of Ponthoise, and there incamped himselfe; who therewith sent word
to the French king, that thither he was come to giue him battell, if he would come
out of his strength and bastiles. But the French king by aduise of his councell,
determined not to venture his person with men of so base degr&eacute;e, but meant to
k&eacute;epe his ground, bidding the lord regent to enter at his perill, and in the meane
season did what he could to stop the passage of the riuer of Oise, so that no vittels
should be brought to the English armie by that waie, in hope so to cause them to
recule backe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A policie for a bridge.</div>

<p>The duke of Yorke, perceiuing that the French king minded not to fight, purposed
to passe ouer the riuer of Oise, and so to fight with him in his lodging. Whervpon
he remooued his campe, and appointed the lord Talbot and other, to make a
countenance, as they would passe the riuer by force at the port of Beaumont: and appointed
an other companie in boates of timber and leather, and bridges made of cords
and ropes (whereof he had great plentie caried with him in chariots) to passe ouer
beneath the abbie. Whilest the lord Talbot made a crie, as though he would assault
the gate, certeine Englishmen passed the water in botes, and drew a bridge of cords
ouer, so that a great number of them were got to the other side, yer the Frenchmen
were aduised what had happened. When they saw the chance, they ran like mad men,
to haue stopped the passage, but it was too late: for the most part of the Englishmen
were got ouer, in so much that they chased their enimies backe, and slue sir Guilliam
de Chastell, nephue to the lord Taneguie du Chastell, and diuerse others.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Enguerant de Monstrellet.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Edw. Hall.</i></div>

<p>The Frenchmen s&eacute;eing their euill hap irrecouerable, returned to the French king,
and told him what had chanced: wherevpon he doubting to be assailed to his disaduantage,
thought not good longer to tarrie, but with all sp&eacute;ed remoouing his ordinance
into the bastile of saint Martin, which he had newlie made, dislodged in the night
from Maubuisson, and went to Poissie, leauing the lord de Cotignie admerall of
France, with thr&eacute;e thousand men to k&eacute;epe the bastile. If he had taried still at
Maubuisson, the lord Talbot which had passed the riuer of Oise in two small leather
botes, had either taken or slaine him the same night. The Englishmen the next daie
in good order of battell came before the towne of Ponthoise, thinking there to haue
found the French king, but he was gone: and in his lodging they found great riches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and much stuffe which he could not haue space for to carrie awaie for feare of the sudden
inuasion.</p>

<p>Then the duke with his power entred into the towne, and sent for new vittels, and
repaired the towers and bulworks about the towne, &amp; diuerse times assaulted the bastile
of the Frenchmen, of the which he made no great accompt, bicause they were not
of power either to assault or stop the vittels or succors from the towne. After this,
the duke intending once againe to offer the French king battell, left behind him at
Ponthoise for capteine there, sir Geruais Clifton, sir Nicholas Burdet, Henrie Chandos,
and a thousand soldiers, and therewith remoouing with his whole armie, came before
Poissie, where he set himselfe and his men in good order of battell readie to fight.
There issued out some of the French gentlemen to skirmish with the Englishmen, but
to their losse: for diuerse of them were slaine, and foure valiant horssemen taken prisoners.
The duke perceiuing the faint hearts of the Frenchmen, and that they durst
not incounter in field with the English power, dislodged from Poissie, and came to
Maunt, and soone after to Rone.</p>

<p>When the regent and the lord Talbot were returned againe into Normandie, the
French king considering how much it should redound to his dishonour to let rest the
towne of Ponthoise in his enimies hands, sith he had b&eacute;ene at such charges and trauell
about the winning thereof, he eftsoones assembled all his puissance. And returning
suddenlie vnto Ponthoise, he first by assault got the church, and after the whole
towne, tooke the capteine, and diuerse other Englishmen, and slue to the number of
foure hundred, which sold their liues dearelie: for one French writer affirmeth, that
the French king lost there thr&eacute;e thousand men; and the whole garrison of the Englishmen
was but onelie a thousand. Among other that were slaine here of the defendants,
was sir Nicholas Burdet knight, ch&eacute;efe butler of Normandie. After this hot tempest,
the weather began somewhat to wax more calme: for king Henrie and king Charles
agr&eacute;ed to send ambassadors to commen of some good conclusion of peace: so that
king Henrie sent the cardinall of Winchester, with diuerse other noble personages
of his councell to Calis, with whome was also sent Charles duke of Orleance yet
prisoner in England, to the intent that he might be both author of the peace, and
also procurer of his owne deliuerance.</p>

<p>The French king sent the archbishop of Reimes, and the earle of Dunois: and
the duke of Burgognie sent the lord de Creuecueur, and diuerse other. All these
met at Calis, where the duke of Orleance courteouslie receiued the earle of Dunois
(his bastard brother) thanking him greatlie for his paines taken in gouerning
his lands &amp; countrie, during the time of his captiuitie and absence. Diuerse
communications were had, as well for the deliuerance of the duke as for a finall peace;
but nothing was concluded, sauing that an other m&eacute;eting was appointed, so that in the
meane season the demands of either partie might be declared to their souereigne lords
and maisters: and herevpon the commissioners brake vp their assemblie, and returned
into their countries. The Englishmen (as the French writers record) required not
onelie to possesse peaceablie the two duches of Aquitane and Normandie, discharged
of all resort, superioritie, and souereigntie against the realme of France, the kings
and gouernours of the same; but also to be restored to all the townes, cities, and places,
which they within thirtie y&eacute;eres next before gone and past, had conquered in the
realme of France. Which request the Frenchmen thought verie vnreasonable, and so
both parties, minding rather to gaine or saue than to loose, departed for that time,
as y&eacute;e haue heard.</p>

<p>After this m&eacute;eting thus proroged, Philip duke of Burgognie, partlie mooued in
conscience to make amends to Charles duke of Orleance (as yet prisoner in England
for the death of duke Lewes his father), whome duke Iohn, father to this duke Philip
cruellie murthered in the citie of Paris; and partlie intending the aduancement of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>

trusted, that all old rancor should ceasse), contriued waies to haue the said duke of
Orleance set at libertie, vpon promise by him made to take the said ladie Marie vnto
wife. This duke had b&eacute;ene prisoner in England euer since the battell was fought
at Agincourt, vpon the daie of Crispine and Crispinian, in the yeare 1415, and was
set now at libertie in the moneth of Nouember, in the yeare 1440, paieng for his
ransome foure hundred thousand crownes, though other saie but thr&eacute;e hundred thousand.</p>

<p>The cause whie he was detained so long in captiuitie, was to pleasure thereby the
duke of Burgognie: for so long as the duke of Burgognie continued faithfull to the king
of England, it was not thought necessarie to suffer the duke of Orleance to be ransomed,
least vpon his deliuerance he would not ceasse to s&eacute;eke meanes to be reuenged vpon
the duke of Burgognie, for the old grudge and displeasure betwixt their two families,
and therefore such ransome was demanded for him as he was neuer able to pay. But
after the duke of Burgognie had broken his promise, and was turned to the French
part, the councell of the king of England deuised how to deliuer the duke of Orleance,
that thereby they might displeasure the duke of Burgognie. Which thing the duke
of Burgognie perceiuing, doubted what might follow if he were deliuered without his
knowledge, and therefore to his great cost practised his deliuerance, paid his ransome,
and ioined with him amitie and aliance by mariage of his n&eacute;ece.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Orleance deliuered.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lewes the twelfe.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<p>This duke being now deliuered, and speaking better English than French, after his
arriuall in France, repaired to the duke of Burgognie, and according to his promise
and conuention, maried the ladie Marie of Cleue, in the towne of saint Omers, on
whome he begat a sonne, which after was French king, and called Lewes the
twelfe. [Festered sores that rankle inward, as they may perchance be palliat by sleight
of surgerie; so sildome come they to sound cure, but often doo burst out againe to
greater paine and perill of patient than euer afore: and so befell it betw&eacute;ene these
two noble houses of Orleance and Burgognie, who for all this mariage and plausible
peace (that continued a twentie yeares) fell out yet after at square vnattonablie:] their
children and cousins, to the great vnquietting of much part of christendome, speciallie
in the times of king Francis the first, and his sonne Henrie the second, heires
of the house of Orleance. For Iohn earle of Angolesme, vncle to this duke
Charles, begat Charles, father to the said king Francis: which earle Iohn had b&eacute;ene
as pledge in England for the debt of Lewes duke of Orleance, from the last yeare
of king Henrie the fourth; till that now his nephue being deliuered, made shift for
monie, and ransomed him also, and at length restored him to his countrie.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this twentith yeare, Richard duke of Yorke, regent of France,
and gouernour of Normandie, determined to inuade the territories of his enimies both
by sundrie armies, and in seuerall places, and therevpon without delaie of time he
sent the lord of Willoughbie with a great crue of soldiers to destroie the countrie
of Amiens, and Iohn lord Talbot was appointed to besiege the towne of Diepe; and
the regent himselfe accompanied with Edmund duke of Summerset, set forward into
the duchie of Aniou. The lord Willoughbie, according to his commission, entred
into the countrie of his enimies in such wise vpon the sudden, that a great number of
people were taken yer they could withdraw into anie place of safegard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earle of saint Paule fr&eacute;end to the English.</div>

<p>The Frenchmen in the garrisons adioining, astonied with the clamour and crie of
the poore people, issued out in good order, and manfullie fought with the Englishmen.
But in the end, the Frenchmen s&eacute;eing their fellowes in the forefront slaine
downe, and kild without mercie, turned their backes, and fled: the Englishmen
followed, and slue manie in the chase; and such as escaped the sword, were robbed
by the earle of saint Paule, who was comming to aid the Englishmen. In this conflict
were slaine aboue six hundred men of armes, and a great number taken. The dukes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of Yorke and Summerset likewise entered into Aniou and Maine, and there
destroied townes, and spoiled the people, and with great preies and prisoners repaired
againe into Normandie, whither also the lord Willoughbie withdrew, after his
valiant enterprise atchiued (as before y&eacute;e haue heard) with rich spoiles and good
prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This should be as <i>Enguerant</i> noteth two yeares after this present yere 19, to wit, <i>An.</i> 1440.</div>

<p>The duke of Summerset vpon further valiance, entered into the marches of Britaine,
and tooke by fierce assault a towne named la Gerche, appertaining to the duke
Alanson, spoiling and burning the same. This doone, he went to Ponzaic, where
he soiorned two moneths, sending foorth dailie his men of war to destroie the countries
of Aniou, Traonnois, and Chatragonnois. The French king sent the marshall
Loiach with foure thousand men to resist the inuasions of the duke of Summerset,
which marshall intended to haue set on the duke in his lodgings in the dead time of the
night: but that (as by a wise and hardie capteine) well fores&eacute;ene, he marched forward,
and met the Frenchmen halfe the waie, and after long fight, discomfited them, slue an
hundred of the marshals men, and tooke thr&eacute;e score and two prisoners, wherof the
ch&eacute;efe were the lord Dausignie, sir Lewes de Buell, all the other (almost) were knights
and esquiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thr&eacute;e thousand hath <i>Nicholas Giles</i>.</div>

<p>After this incounter, the duke tooke the towne of Beaumont le vicount, and manned
all the fortresses on the frontiers of his enimies, and with rich booties and prisoners
returned againe to the duke of Yorke. In this meane time the lord Talbot, besieging
the towne of Diepe, inuironed it with d&eacute;epe trenches; building also vpon the
mount Paulet a strong and noisome bastile. But at length perceiuing the towne to
be stronglie defended, and that he lacked such furniture of men, vittels and ordinance
as was necessarie for the winning of it, he deliuered the custodie of the bastile, with
the gouernance of the siege to his bastard sonne, a valiant yoong gentleman, and departed
to Rone for aid, monie, and munition. The French king aduertised hereof,
sent his sonne the Dolphin of Vienne with the earle of Dunois, and fift&eacute;ene thousand
men to raise the siege from Diepe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of saint Paule reuolteth to the French.</div>

<p>Thr&eacute;e daies they assailed the bastile, in the which six hundred Englishmen were inclosed,
and at length bicause powder and weapon failed them within, the Frenchmen
wan it, and tooke the bastard Talbot prisoner, with sir William Peitow, and sir Iohn
Repleie, which shortlie after were red&eacute;emed. The other English souldiers s&eacute;eing the
bastile woone by the Frenchmen, stood all a daie in good order of battell, and in the
night following, politikelie saued themselues and returned to Rone, without losse or
damage. In the assaulting of the bastile, the Frenchmen saie, they slue two hundred
Englishmen; and denie not but that they lost fiue hundred of their owne men,
beside those that were hurt. Whilest these things were a dooing, Philip duke of
Burgognie made sharpe warre against the earle of saint Paule, in taking from him
his townes and castels, that made him to renounce his allegiance swoorne and promised
to the king of England, and returned to the French part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1441.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Tartas besieged.</div>

<p>The English capteins in Guien besieged the strong towne of Tartas, belonging to
the lord Dalbreth their old and ancient enimie. The towne perceiuing that it was
not able to resist the force of the Englishmen anie long time, tooke appointment, that
the towne should remaine neuter. For assurance therof, they deliuered Cadet the sonne
of the lord de la Breth in pledge, vpon this condition; that if the said lord de la
Breth would not assent to the agr&eacute;ement, then he should signifie his refusall to the
English capteins within thr&eacute;e moneths next insuing, and he to haue his pledge, and
they to doo their best. The French king, at the request of the lords of Guien, caused
the lord de la Breth to signifie his disagr&eacute;ement vnto the earle of Huntington, as then
lieutenant to the king of England in the duchie of Aquitaine. And therewith to
gratifie the lords of Guien, he assembled an armie of thr&eacute;escore thousand men, &amp; came
to Tholouse, and so to Tartas, to whome the ch&eacute;efteins of the towne, s&eacute;eing no suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>cours
comming from the king of England, rendred the towne: and Cadet de la Breth,
which was left there as a pledge, was also deliuered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The change in warre.</div>

<p>The French king, after the y&eacute;elding of Tartas, remooued to saint Seuerine, which
towne he tooke by force, slue thr&eacute;e hundred persons, and tooke sir Thomas Rampston
prisoner. After this, he came to the citie of Arques, tooke a bulworke by force, and
had the towne y&eacute;elded to him by composition. The capteine, which was the lord of
Montferrant, departed with all the English crue to Burdeaux, where he found the earle
of Longuile, the Capdau de Beufe, and sir Thomas Rampston, which was a little
before deliuered. After this, the fortresses of the Rioll and Mermandie were also
y&eacute;elded to the French king: who notwithstanding at length was constreined for
lacke of vittels (which were cut off by the Englishmen that laie abroad in diuerse
fortresses for the purpose) to breake vp his armie, &amp; to retire into France. And then
after his departure, the Englishmen recouered againe the citie of Arques, &amp; the other
townes by the French king gained, and tooke prisoner his lieutenant called Reginald
Guilliam the Burgognion, and manie other gentlemen, and all the meane souldiers
were either slaine or hanged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Talbot.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Dunois.</div>

<div class="sidenote">An excellent finesse in warre.</div>

<p>While the French king was in Guien, the lord Talbot tooke the towne of Couchet,
and after marched toward Galliardon, which was besieged by the bastard of Orleance,
otherwise called the earle of Dunois: which earle hearing of the lord Talbots approch,
raised his siege, and saued himselfe. The Frenchmen a little before this season, had
taken the towne of Eureux by treason of a fisher. Sir Francis the Arragonois hearing
of that chance, apparelled six strong fellowes, like men of the countrie, with sacks
and baskets, as cariers of corne and vittels, and sent them to the castell of Cornill,
in the which diuerse Englishmen were kept as prisoners, and he with an ambush of
Englishmen laie in a vallie nigh to the fortresse.</p>

<p>The six counterfet husbandmen entered the castell vnsuspected, and streight came
to the chamber of the capteine, &amp; laieng hands on him, gave knowledge to them that
laie in ambush to come to their aid. The which suddenlie made foorth, and entered
the castell, slue and tooke all the Frenchmen, and set the Englishmen at libertie:
which thing doone, they set fire in the castell, and departed to Rone with their bootie
and prisoners. This exploit they had not atchiued peraduenture by force (as happilie
they mistrusted) and therefore by subtiltie and deceit sought to accomplish it, which
meanes to vse in warre is tollerable, so the same warre be lawfull; though both fraud
&amp; bloudshed otherwise be forbidden euen by the instinct of nature to be put in
practise and vse; and that dooth the poet insinuat in a proper sententious verse,

<div class="sidenote">A new breach betw&eacute;ene the duke of Glocester, and the bishop of Winchester.</div>

<p>But now to speake somewhat of the dooings in England in the meane time. Whilest
the men of war were thus occupied in martiall feates, and dailie skirmishes, within
the realme of France: ye shall vnderstand, that after the cardinall of Winchester,
and the duke of Glocester, were (as it s&eacute;emed) reconciled either to other, yet the
cardinall, and the archbishop of Yorke ceassed not to doo manie things without the
consent of the king or of the duke, being (during the minoritie of the king) gouernor
and protector of the realme, whereas the duke (as good cause he had) greatlie offended,
therevpon in writing declared to the king, wherein the cardinall and the archbishop
had offended both his maiestie, and the lawes of the realme. This complaint of the
duke of Glocester was conteined in foure and twentie articles, which chieflie rested,
in that the cardinall had from time to time, through his ambitious desire to surmount
all others in high degr&eacute;es of honor and dignitie, sought to inrich himselfe, to the great
and notorious hinderance of the king, as in defrauding him not onelie of his treasure,
but also in dooing and practising things greatlie preiudiciall to his affaires in France, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ex Ed. Hall.</i> 143, 144, 145, 146.</div>

<p>1 THESE be in part, the points and articles, which I Humfrie duke of Glocester, for
my truth &amp; acquitall, said late, I would giue in writing (my right redoubted lord) vnto
your highnesse, aduertising your excellencie, of such things in part, as haue b&eacute;ene
doone in your tender age, in derogation of your noble estate, and hurt of both your
realmes, and yet be doone and vsed dailie.</p>

<p>2 First, the cardinall then being bishop of Winchester, tooke vpon him the state
of cardinall, which was naied and denaied him, by the king of most noble memorie,
my lord your father (whome God assoile) saieng that he had as l&eacute;efe set his crowne
beside him, as s&eacute;e him weare a cardinals hat, he being a cardinall. For he knew full
well, the pride and ambition that was in his person, then being but a bishop, should
haue so greatlie extolled him into more intollerable pride, when that he were a cardinall:
and also he thought it against his fr&eacute;edome, of the ch&eacute;efe church of this realme,
which, that he worshipped, as dulie as euer did prince, that blessed be his soule.
And howbeit, that my said lord your father (whome God assoile) would haue agr&eacute;ed
him to haue had certeine clearks of this land cardinals, and to haue no bishoprikes in
England; yet his intent was neuer to doo so great derogation to the church of Canturburie,
to make them that were his suffragans, to sit aboue their ordinarie and metropolitan.
But the cause was that in generall, and in all matters which might concerne
the weale of him, and of his realme, he should haue proctors of his nation, as
other kings Christen had, in the court of Rome, and not to abide in this land, nor
to be in anie part of his councels, as b&eacute;ene all the spirituall and temporall, at parlements
and other great councels, when you list to call them. And therefore, though it please
you to doo him that worshop, to set him in your priuie councell after your pleasure:
yet in your parlement, where euerie lord both spirituall and temporall, hath his place,
he ought to occupie but his place as a bishop.</p>

<p>3 Item, the said bishop, now being cardinall, was assoiled of his bishoprike of
Winchester, wherevpon he sued vnto our holie father, to haue a bull declaratorie, notwithstanding
he was assumpt to the state of cardinall, that the s&eacute;e was not void,
where in d&eacute;ed it stood void by a certeine time, yet the said bull were granted; and so
he was exempt from his ordinarie, by the taking on him the state of Cardinall, and the
church bishoprike of Winchester, so standing void, he tooke againe of the pope (you
not learned thereof ne knowing whereby he was fallen into the case of prouision) so that
all his good was lawfullie &amp; cl&eacute;erlie forfeited to you my right doubted lord, with
more; as the statute declareth plainelie for your aduantage.</p>

<p>4 Item, it is not vnknowen to you (doubted lord) how thorough your lands it is
noised, that the said cardinall and the archbishop of Yorke had and haue the gouernance
of you, and all your land, the which none of your true liege men ought to
vsurpe nor take vpon them. And haue also estranged me your sole vncle, my cousine of
Yorke, my coosine of Huntington, and manie other lords of your kin, to haue anie
knowledge of anie great matter, that might touch your high estate, or either of your
realmes. And of lords spirituall, of right, the archbishop of Canturburie should be
your ch&eacute;efe councellor, the which is also estranged and set aside. And so be manie
other right sad lords, and well aduised, as well spirituall as temporall, to the great
hurt of you my right doubted lord, and of your realmes, like as the experience and
workes shewen cl&eacute;erelie and euidentlie, more harme it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>5 Item, in the tender age of you, my right doubted lord, for the necessitie of an
armie, the said cardinall lent you foure thousand pounds vpon certeine iewels, prised
at two and twentie thousand markes, with a letter of sale, that and they were not
quited at a certeine daie, you should l&eacute;ese them. The said cardinall s&eacute;eing your monie
readie to haue quited your iewels, caused your treasuror of England, at that daie being,
to paie the same monie, in part of an other armie, in defrauding you my right doubted
lord of your said iewels, k&eacute;eping them yet all awaie to his owne vse, to your right
great losse, and his singular profit and auaile.</p>

<p>6 Item, the said cardinall, then being bishop of Winchester, and chancellour of
England, deliuered the king of Scots, vpon certeine appointments (as maie be shewed)
presumptuouslie, and of his owne authoritie, contrarie to the act of parlement. I haue
heard notable men of law say, that they neuer heard the like thing doone among them:
which was too great a defamation to your highnesse, and also to wed his n&eacute;ece to the
said king, whom that my lord of notable memorie, your father, whome God assoile,
would neuer haue so deliuered. And there as he should haue paid for his costs fortie
thousand pounds, the said cardinall, chancellour of England, caused you to pardon
him thereof ten thousand marks, whereof the greater summe he paied you, right a
little, what, I report me to your highnesse.</p>

<p>7 Item, where the said cardinall lent you, my redoubted lord, great and notable
summes, he hath had and his assignes, the rule and profit of the port of Hampton,
where the customers b&eacute;ene his seruants, where (by likelihood and as it is to be supposed)
standing the ch&eacute;efe merchant of the wools of your land, that you be greatlie
defrauded, and vnder that rule, what wools and other merchandizes haue b&eacute;ene shipped,
and maie be from time to time, hard is to est&eacute;eme, to the great hurt and preiudice
of you my right doubted lord, and of all your people.</p>

<p>8 Item, howbeit that the said cardinall hath diuerse times lent you great summes
of monie, since the time of your reigne, yet his loane hath b&eacute;ene so deferred and
delaied, that for the most part, the conuenable season of the imploieng of the good
lent was passed. So that litle fruit or none came thereof, as by experience both your
realmes haue sufficientlie in knowledge.</p>

<p>9 Item, where there was iewels and plate prised at eleuen thousand pounds in
weight, of the said cardinall, forfeited to you my right redoubted lord, he gat him
a restorement thereof for a loane of a little parcell of the same: and so defrauded you
wholie of them, to your great hurt, and his auaile, the which good might greatlie haue
eased your highnesse, in sparing as much of the poore commons.</p>

<p>10 Item, the cardinall being feoft of my said lord your father (whome God assoile)
against his intent, gaue Elizabeth Beauchampe, thr&eacute;e hundred markes liuelihood,
where that his will was, that and she were wedded within a yeare, then to haue it,
or else not, where in d&eacute;ed it was two or thr&eacute;e years after, to your great hurt, and
diminishing of your inheritance.</p>

<p>11 Item, notwithstanding that the said cardinall hath no maner of authoritie nor
interest in the crowne, nor none maie haue by anie possibilitie; yet he presumeth and
taketh vpon him in partie, your estate roiall, in calling before him, into great abusion
of all your land, and derogation of your highnesse, which hath not b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene nor
vsed in no daies heretofore, in greater estate than he is, without your expresse ordinance
and commandement.</p>

<p>12 Item, the said cardinall, nothing considering the necessitie of you my right
doubted lord, hath sued a pardon of dismes, that he should paie for the church of
Winchester, for terme of his life, giuing thereby occasion to all other lords spirituall,
to draw their good will for anie necessitie, to grant anie disme: and so to laie
all the charge vpon the temporaltie, and the poore people.</p>

<p>13 Item, by the gouernance and labour of the said cardinall, and archbishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Yorke, there hath b&eacute;ene lost and dispended much notable and great good, by diuerse
ambassadors sent out of this realme. First to Arras, for a feigned colourable peace,
whereas by likelinesse it was thought and supposed, that it should neuer turne to
the effectuall auaile of you my right doubted lord, nor to your said realmes: but
vnder colour thereof, was made the peace of your aduersarie, and the duke of Burgognie.
For else your partie aduerse, &amp; the said duke, might not well haue found
meanes nor waies to haue communed togither, nor to haue concluded with other
their confederations and conspirations made and wrought there, then, at that time,
against your highnesse, whereby you might haue (right doubted lord) the greater partie
of your obeisance, as well in your realme of France, as in your duchie of Normandie,
and much other thing gone greatlie, as through the said colourable treatie,
&amp; otherwise, since the death of my brother of Bedford (whome God assoile.)</p>

<p>14 Item, now of late was sent an other ambassador to Calis, by the labour and
counsell of the said cardinall, and archbishop of Yorke, the cause why of the beginning,
is to me your sole vncle, and other lords of your kin and councell vnknowen,
to your great charge, and against the publike good of your realme; as it openlie
appeareth. The which good if it be imploied for the defense of your lands, the
merchandizes of the same might haue had other course, and your said lands not to
haue stand in so great misch&eacute;efe as they doo.</p>

<p>15 Item, after that, to your great charge, and hurt of both your realmes, the said
cardinall &amp; archbishop of Yorke went to your said towne of Calis, and diuerse
lords of your kin, and of your councell in their fellowship, and there, as there was
naturall warre betw&eacute;ene the duke of Orleance, and the duke of Burgognie, for murther
of their fathers, a capitall enimitie like to haue indured for euer: the said cardinall
and archbishop of Yorke licenced and suffered the said duke of Orleance, to
intreat and common apart with the councell of your said aduersaries, as well as with
the duchies of Burgognie: by which meane the peace and aliance was made betw&eacute;ene
the two dukes, to the greatest fortifieng of your said capitall aduersaries that could
be thought, and consequentlie (my d&eacute;ere redoubted lord) to your greatest charge,
and hurt to both your realmes. Vnder colour of which treatie, your said aduersaries
in meane time wan your citie of Meaux, and the countrie thereabout, and manie
diuerse roades made into your duchie of Normandie, to the great noisance and destruction
of your people, as it sheweth openlie.</p>

<p>16 Item, the said archbishop of Yorke, sent with other into this your realme from
the said cardinall, after communication had with your aduerse partie, at your said
towne of Calis, made at his comming into your notable presence at Windesor, all
the suasions and colour, all motions in the most apparant wise that he could, to induce
your highnesse to your agr&eacute;ement, to the desires of your capitall aduersaries, as
I saw there in your noble presence of his writing, at which time (as I vnderstood)
it was his singular opinion, that is to saie: that you should leaue your right, your
title, and your honour of your crowne, and nomination of you king of France, during
certeine yeares, &amp; that you should vtterlie absteine you and be content onelie in
writing, with Rex Angli&aelig;, &amp;c. to the great note of infamie that euer fell to you or
anie of your noble progenitours, since the taking of them first, the said title and right
of your realme and crowne of France. To which matter in your presence there, after
that it had liked your said highnesse, to aske mine aduise therevpon, with other of
your blood and councell; I answerd and said, that I would neuer agr&eacute;e me thereto to die
therfore, and of the same disposition I am yet, and will be while I liue in conseruation
of your honour, and of your oth made vnto your said crowne, in time of your coronation
there.</p>

<p>17 Item, the said cardinall and archbishop of Yorke, haue so laboured vnto your
highnesse, that you should intend to a new daie of conuention, in March or Aprill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
next comming, where it is noised to be more against your worship than with it. And
where it was euident to all the world, that the rupture and breaking of the said peace,
should haue fallen heretofore, of your aduerse partie; because of the great vntruths.
Now by that meanes it is like peraduenture to be laid vnto the verie great slander of
you my doubted lord, like to come to none other purpose nor effect, than other conuentions
haue doone afore time: and so by subtilties and counsell of your said enimies,
your land (they in hope and trust of the said treatie, not mightilie nor puissantlie
purueied for) shall be like vnder the colour of the same treatie to be burnt vp and
destroied, lost, and vtterlie turned from your obeisance.</p>

<p>18 Item it is said, that the deliuerance of the said duke of Orleance, is vtterlie
appointed by the mediation, counsell, and stirring of the said cardinall and archbishop
of Yorke; and for that cause diuerse persons b&eacute;ene come from your aduersaries, into
this your realme, and the said duke also brought to your citie of London, where as
my lord your father (whom God assoile) peising so greatlie the inconueniences; and
harme that might fall, onlie by his deliuerance, concluded, ordeined, and determined
in his last will, vtterlie in his wisedome, his conquest in his realme of France. And
yet then it is to be doone, by as great deliberation, solemnitie and suertie, as may be
deuised or thought. And s&eacute;eing now the disposition of your realme of France, the
puissance and might of your enimies, and what aid they haue gotten against you there,
aswell vnder the colour of the said treatie, as otherwise; what may or ought to be
thought or said, for that laboring the said duke (all things considered) by such particular
persons, the lords of your bloud not called therevnto, I report me vnto your
noble grace and excellencie, and vnto the said wise true men of this your realme.</p>

<p>19 Item, where that euerie true councellor, speciallie vnto anie king or prince,
ought of truth and of dutie, to counsell, promote, increase, prefer, and aduance
the weale and prosperitie of his lord: the said cardinall, being of your councell (my
right doubted lord) hath late purchased of your highnesse, certeine great lands and
liuelod: as the castell and lordship of Chirke in Wales, and other lands in this your
realme; vnto which I was called suddenlie, and so in eschewing the breaking and losse
of your armies then againe, s&eacute;eing none other remedie, gaue therevnto mine assent,
thinking that who that euer laboured, moued or stirred the matter first vnto your
lordship, counselled you neither for your worship nor profit.</p>

<p>20 More, the said cardinall hath you bound apart, to make him a sure estate of
all the said lands, by Easter next comming, as could be deuised by anie learned counsell;
or else that suertie not made, the said cardinall to haue and enioy to him, and
his heirs for euermore, the lands of the duchie of Lancaster, in Norffolke, to the
value of seuen or eight hundred marks by yeare. Which thing s&eacute;emeth right strange
and vns&eacute;ene, and vnhard waies of anie liege man, to s&eacute;eke vpon his souereigne lord,
both in his inheritance and in his iewels and goods. For it is thought, but if
right and extreame necessitie caused it, there should, nor ought no such things to
be doone: from which necessitie God (for his mercie) euer preserue your noble person.
Wherfore my redoubted lord, s&eacute;eing that ye should be so counselled, or
stirred to leaue your crowne and inheritance in England; and also by fraud and
subtill meanes, as is afore rehearsed, so to lose your iewels: in my truth and in
mine acquitall (as me s&eacute;emeth) I may not nor ought not counsell so great an hurt to
you and to all your land.</p>

<p>21 Item, it is not vnknowen to you my right doubted lord, how oftentimes I
haue offered my seruice, to and for the defense of your realme of France, and duchie
of Normandie, where I haue b&eacute;ene put there-from by the labour of the said cardinall,
in preferring other after his singular affection. Which hath caused a great part of
the said duchie of Normandie, aswell as of your realme of France to be lost, as it is
well knowen. And what good (my right doubted lord) was lost on that armie that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
last sent thither, which the earle of Mortaigne, your councell of France, hath well
&amp; cl&eacute;erelie declared to your highnesse here before?</p>

<p>22 Item, my right doubted lord, it is not vnknowen, that it had not b&eacute;ene possible
to the said cardinall, to haue come to his great riches, but by such meanes, for of
his church it might not rise, and inheritance he had none. Wherfore my right
doubted lord, sith there is great good behouefull at this time, for the weale and
safegard of your realmes, the pouertie, necessitie, &amp; indigence of your liege people;
in highnesse vnderstand, like it vnto your noble grace, to consider the said lucre of
the said cardinall, and the great deceipts that you be receiued in by the labour of
him &amp; of the archbishop, aswell in this your realme as in your realme of France and
duchie of Normandie, where neither office, liuelod, nor capteine may be had, without
too great good giuen vnto him, wherby a great part of all the losse that is lost,
they haue b&eacute;ene the causers of; for who that would giue most, his was the price, not
considering the merits, seruice, nor sufficiance of persons. Furthermore, it is greatlie
to be considered, how, when the said cardinall had forfeited all his goods, bicause
of prouision, as the statute therevpon more plainelie declareth; by hauing the rule
of you my right doubted lord, purchased himselfe in great defraudation of your highnesse,
a charter of pardon, the which good and it had be well gouerned, might manie
yeares haue susteined your warres, without anie tallage of your poore people.</p>

<p>23 Item, my redoubted lord, whereas I write much thing for the weale of you and
of your realms, peraduenture some will saie and vnderstand, that I would or haue written
by waie of accusement of all your councell, which God knoweth, I doo not: for your
highnesse may well s&eacute;e, that I name them that be causers of the said inordinate rule.
Wherfore, considering that the said cardinall and archbishop of Yorke b&eacute;ene they,
that pretend the gouernance of you, and of your realmes and lordships: please it vnto
your highnesse, of your right wisenesse to estrange them of your councell, to that
intent, that men may be at their fr&eacute;edome, to say what they thinke of truth.</p>

<p>24 For truth, I dare speake of my truth, the poore dare not doo so. And if the
cardinall and the archbishop of Yorke, may afterward declare themselues, of that is,
and shalbe said of them; you my right doubted lord may then restore them againe to
your councell, at your noble pleasure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the king had heard the accusations thus laid by the duke of Glocester
against the cardinall, he committed the examination thereof to his councell, whereof
the more part were spirituall persons; so that what for feare, and what for fauor, the
matter was winked at, and nothing said to it: onelie faire countenance was made to
the duke, as though no malice had b&eacute;ene conceiued against him. But venem will
breake out, &amp; inward grudge will soone appeare, which was this yeare to all men apparant:
for diuers secret attempts were aduanced forward this season against this

<p>For first this yeare, dame Eleanor Cobham, wife to the said duke, was accused of
treason; for that she by sorcerie and inchantment intended to destroie the king, to
the intent to aduance hir husband vnto the crowne. Vpon this, she was examined
in saint Stephans chappell before the bishop of Canturburie, and there by examination
conuict, and iudged to doo open penance in thr&eacute;e open places within the citie of
London. [Polychronicon saith she was inioined to go through Cheapside with a
taper in hir hand] and after that adiudged to perpetuall imprisonment in the Ile of
Man, vnder the k&eacute;eping of sir Iohn Stanlie knight. At the same season were arrested,
arreigned, and adiudged giltie, as aiders to the duchesse, Thomas Southwell

<p>The matter laid against them, was, for that they (at the request of the said

by little and little consumed, intending thereby in conclusion to waste and destroie the
kings person. Margerie Iordeine was burnt in Smithfield, and Roger Bolingbrooke
was drawne to Tiborne, and hanged and quartered; taking vpon his death that there
was neuer anie such thing by them imagined. Iohn Hun had his pardon, and Southwell
died in the Tower the night before his execution: [for (saith Polychr.) he did
prophesie of himselfe, that he should die in his bed, and not by iustice.] The duke
of Glocester bare all these things patientlie, and said little. Edward sonne to the

draper, and Rafe Holland tailor, and them presented by name vnto the maior and
his brethren, then sitting in the vtter chamber where the maiors courts be kept, to
the intent that the said maior and his brethren might choose one of the said two, such
as they thought most necessarie and worshipfull for the roome; the said maior and
his brethren choosing Robert Clopton, brought him after downe vpon his right hand
towards the hall. Whereof when certeine tailors there present were aware, and saw
that Rafe Holland was not chosen, anon they cried; Nay, nay: not this, but Rafe
Holland. Wherewith the old maior being astonished, stood still vpon the staire, and
commanded them to k&eacute;epe silence, and so held on his waie to the east end of the hall,
where he sat him downe, and his brethren about him. In the meane time, the said tailors
continued their crie, and incensed others of base trades of the citie (as simple persons)
to take their part, and to crie as fast as they, not proffering to cease their misrule for
all that the maior could saie, no nor yet when the maiors sergeant at armes had cried
O-yes. Herevpon the maior, to appease the rumor, sent downe the shiriffes, and
commanded them to take the offendors, and send them to the goale; which precept was
fulfilled, &amp; about twelue or sixt&eacute;ene of the principall committed to Newgate, where
some of them abode a long time imprisoned; and others that were fined set at libertie.

<p>The councell of England forgat not the late enterprise of the French king, atchiued

thither sir William Wooduile with eight hundred men, to strengthen the frontiers,
and further, set foorth a proclamation, that all men which would transport anie corne,
ch&eacute;ese, or other vittels thither, should paie no maner of custome of tallage: which
licence caused the countrie of Aquitaine to be well furnished of all things necessarie.
About this season Iohn the valiant lord Talbot for his approued prowesse and wisdome,
aswell in England as in France, both in peace &amp; warre so well tried, was created earle
of Shrewesburie, and with a companie of thr&eacute;e thousand men sent againe into Normandie,

letters to the couent of Elie, to make election of Thomas Rudburne (bishop of S.
Dauids in Wales) for their bishop. But they contrarie therevnto (taking it now for a
custome, hauing so often vsed it before, as did well appeare) made choise of Thomas
Bourchier (borne of a noble house, sonne to the countesse of Stafford, chancellor of
Oxenford, and bishop of Worcester) to succ&eacute;ed Philip Morgan. Which Bourchier,
the king (offended with the moonkes for the little regard had to his request) vtterlie
refused, and would not admit him vnto that place. Wherevpon there were buls procured
from Eugenius the fourth (then bishop of Rome) which were sent into England
to conlirme the Election of the said Bourchier.</p>

<p>But he wiselie fearing to fall into the dangerous statute of Premunire, durst not
receiue or execute the tenor of the popes commandement. By reason whereof least
the s&eacute;e might otherwise remaine void, (if sp&eacute;edie remedie were not prouided) the king
did in commendam bestow the bishoprike of Elie vpon this Lodowike Lischburne archbishop
of Rone, by office, Card. 4. Coronat. Cancellar. Franci&aelig; &amp; Normanni&aelig;, and
kinsman to the said king. Which doone, Eugenius (when he saw no other remedie)
did reuoke his buls made before to Thomas Bourchier, in the yeare of Christ 1437.
This Lodowike remaining bishop six yeares and so manie moneths, died in the yeare
as before, the eight&eacute;enth of September, at his manor of Hatfield, whose bowels were
buried in the said church: his hart was caried to Rone, and there honourablie intoomed,
and his bodie was committed to the earth, in the church of Elie, betw&eacute;ene
two marble pillors next to the altar of the relikes.</p>

<p>In this yeare died in Guien the countesse of Comings, to whome the French king
and also the earle of Arminacke pretended to be heire, in so much that the earle
entred into all the lands of the said ladie. And bicause he knew the French king
would not take the matter well, to haue a Rouland for an Oliuer; he sent solemne
ambassadours to the king of England, offering him his daughter in mariage, with
promise to be bound (beside great summes of monie, which he would giue with hir)
to deliuer into the king of Englands hands, all such castels and townes, as he or his
ancestors deteined from him within anie part of the duchie of Aquitaine, either by
conquest of his progenitors, or by gift and deliuerie of anie French king: and further
to aid the same king with monie for the recouerie of other cities within the same
duchie, from the French king; or from anie other person that against king Henrie
vniustlie kept, and wrongfullie withholden them.</p>

home into their countrie. After whome were sent for the conclusion of the marriage
into Guien, sir Edward Hull, sir Robert Ros, and Iohn Gralton deane of S. Seuerines,
the which (as all the chronographers agr&eacute;e) both concluded the mariage, and by proxie
affied the yoong ladie. The French king not a little offended herewith, sent his eldest
sonne Lewes the Dolphin of Vienne into Rouergue with a puissant armie, which tooke
the earle and his yoongest sonne, with both his daughters, and by force obteined the
countries of Arminacke, Louuergne, Rouergue, and Moulessonois, beside the cities
Seuerac &amp; Cadeac, chasing the bastard of Arminacke out of his countries, and so by
reason hereof, the concluded mariage was deferred, and that so long that it neuer tooke

the force whereof did principallie extend to tailors and shoomakers (who as on that daie
bring home their garments and shoos to the parties for whome they are made) and

<div class="sidenote">The diet at Tours for a peace to be had betw&eacute;ene England and France.</div>

<p>Whilest England was vnquieted (as you haue heard) and France by spoile, slaughter,
and burning sore defaced (a misch&eacute;efe in all places much lamented) therefore to agr&eacute;e
the two puissant kings, all the princes of christendome trauelled so effectuouslie by
their oratours and ambassadours, that a diet was appointed to be kept at the citie of
Tours in Touraine; where for the king of England appeared William de la Poole earle
of Suffolke, doctor Adam Molins k&eacute;eper of the kings priuie seale, also sir Robert Ros,
and diuers other. And for the French king were appointed Charles duke of Orleance,
Lewes de Bourbon earle of Vandosme, great maister of the French kings houshold,
Piers de Bresse steward of Poictou, and Bertram Beauuan lord of Presignie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A truce for 18 moneths.</div>

<p>There were also sent thither ambassadours from the empire, from Spaine, from Denmarke,
&amp; from Hungarie; to be mediatours betwixt the two princes. The assemblie
was great, but the cost was much greater, insomuch that euerie part for the honour of
their prince and praise of their countrie, set foorth themselues, as well in fare as apparell,
to the vttermost. Manie m&eacute;etings were had, and manie things mooued for a
finall peace: but in conclusion, by reason of manie doubts which rose on both parties,
no full concord could be agr&eacute;ed vpon; but in hope to come to a peace, a certeine truce,
as well by sea as by land, was concluded by the commissioners for eight&eacute;ene moneths,
which afterward againe was prolonged to the yeare of our Lord 1449.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1444</div>

<p>In treating of this truce, the earle of Suffolke aduenturing somewhat vpon his commission,
without the assent of his associats, imagined, that the next waie to come to
a perfect peace, was to contriue a mariage betw&eacute;ene the French kings kinsewoman,
the ladie Margaret daughter to Reiner duke of Aniou, and his souereigne lord king
Henrie. This Reiner duke of Aniou named himselfe king of Sicill, Naples, and Ierusalem,
hauing onlie the name and stile of those realmes; without anie penie, profit,
or foot of possession. This mariage was made strange to the earle at the first, and
one thing s&eacute;emed to be a great hinderance to it; which was, bicause the king of England
occupied a great part of the duchie of Aniou, and the whole countie of Maine,
apperteining (as was alledged) to king Reiner.</p>

<p>The earle of Suffolke (I cannot saie either corrupted with bribes, or too much affectioned
to this vnprofitable mariage), condescended, that the duchie of Aniou and the
countie of Maine should be deliuered to the king, the brides father demanding for hir mariage
neither penie nor farthing: as who would saie, that this new affinitie passed all
riches, and excelled both gold and pretious stones. And to the intent that of this truce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
might insue a finall concord, a daie of enteruiew was appointed betw&eacute;ene the two
kings in a place conuenient betw&eacute;ene Chartres and Rone. When these things were
concluded, the earle of Suffolke with his companie returned into England, where he
forgat not to declare what an honourable truce he had taken, out of the which there
was a great hope that a finall peace might grow the sooner for that honorable mariage,
which he had concluded, omitting nothing that might extoll and set foorth the personage
of the ladie, or the nobilitie of hir kinred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The protector misliked this second motion of the kings mariage.</div>

<p>But although this mariage pleased the king and diuerse of his councell, yet Humfrie
duke of Glocester protector of the realme was much against it, alledging that it should
be both contrarie to the lawes of God, and dishonorable to the prince, if he should
breake that promise and contract of mariage, made by ambassadours sufficientlie
thereto instructed, with the daughter of the earle of Arminacke, vpon conditions
both to him and his realme, as much profitable as honorable. But the dukes words
could not be heard, for the earles dooings were onelie liked and allowed. So that for
performance of the conclusions, the French king sent the earle of Vandosme, great
maister of his house, and the archbishop of Reimes first p&eacute;ere of France, and diuerse
other into England, where they were honorablie receiued; and after that the instruments
were once sealed and deliuered on both parts, the said ambassadours returned
againe into their countries with great gifts and rewards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Creations of estates.</div>

<p>When these things were doone, the king both for honour of his realme, and to assure
to himselfe mo fr&eacute;ends, created Iohn Holland earle of Huntington duke of Excester
as his father was: Humfrie earle of Stafford was made duke of Buckingham:
and Henrie earle of Warwike was elected to the title of duke of Warwike, to whome
the king also gaue the castell of Bristowe, with the Ile of Iernesenie, and Garneseie.
Also the earle of Suffolke was made marquesse of Suffolke, which marquesse with his
wife and manie honorable personages of men and women richlie adorned both with
apparell &amp; iewels, hauing with them manie costlie chariots and gorgeous horslitters,
sailed into France for the conueiance of the nominated qu&eacute;ene into the realme of England.
For king Reiner hir father, for all his long stile had too short a pursse to send
his daughter honorablie to the king hir spouse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 23.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1445.</div>

<p>This noble companie came to the citie of Tours in Touraine, where they were
honorablie receiued both of the French king and of the king of Sicill. The marquesse
of Suffolke as procurator to king Henrie, espoused the said ladie in the church
of saint Martins. At the which mariage were present the father and mother of the
bride; the French king himselfe, which was vncle to the husband; and the French
qu&eacute;ene also, which was aunt to the wife. There were also the dukes of Orleance, of
Calabre, of Alanson, and of Britaine, seauen earls, twelue barons, twentie bishops,
beside knights and gentlemen. When the feast, triumph, bankets and iusts were
ended, the ladie was deliuered to the marquesse, who in great estate conueied hir
through Normandie vnto Diepe, and so transported hir into England, where she
landed at Portesmouth in the moneth of Aprill. This ladie excelled all other, as well
in beautie and fauour, as in wit and policie, and was of stomach and courage more like
to a man than a woman.</p>

<p>Shortlie after hir arriuall, she was conueied to the towne of Southwike in Hamshire,
where she with all nuptiall ceremonies was coupled in matrimonie to king Henrie the
sixt of that name. &para; On the eight&eacute;enth of Maie she came to London, all the lords of
England in most sumptuous sort m&eacute;eting and receiuing hir vpon the waie, and speciallie
the duke of Glocester with such honour as stood with the dignitie of his person.
Now when she came to Blackheath, the maior, aldermen, and men of occupations,
in blew gownes imbrodered with some deuise, expressing their art and trades whereby
to be knowne, did all shew themselues, with congratulation of hir comming; from
whence they attended hir to London, where with goodlie pageants and sundrie gallant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
historicall shewes in diuerse places erected, she was verie magnificallie welcomed.

of the king, qu&eacute;ene, &amp; states is verie amplie set foorth by Fabian, pag. 423, 424,

<div class="sidenote">An ominous mariage.</div>

<p>This mariage s&eacute;emed to manie both infortunate and vnprofitable to the realme of
England, and that for manie causes. First, the king had not one penie with hir; and
for the fetching of hir, the marquesse of Suffolke demanded a whole fift&eacute;enth in open
parlement. And also there was deliuered for hir the duchie of Aniou, the citie of
Mans, and the whole countie of Maine, which countries were the verie staies and
backestands to the duchie of Normandie. And furthermore, the earle of Arminacke
tooke such displeasure with the king of England for this mariage, that he became
vtter enimie to the crowne of England, and was the ch&eacute;efe cause that the Englishmen
were expelled out of the whole duchie of Aquitaine.</p>

<p>But most of all it should s&eacute;eme, that God was displeased with this mariage: for
after the confirmation thereof, the kings fr&eacute;ends fell from him, both in England and
in France, the lords of his realme fell at diuision, and the commons rebelled in such
sort, that finallie after manie fields foughten, and manie thousands of men slaine, the
king at length was deposed, and his sonne killed, and this qu&eacute;ene sent home againe,
with as much miserie and sorrow as she was receiued with pompe and triumph: such
is the instabilitie of worldlie felicitie, and so wauering is false flattering fortune. Which
mutation and change of the better for the worse could not but nettle and sting hir
with pensiuenesse, yea and anie other person whatsoeuer, that hauing b&eacute;ene in good
estate, falleth into the contrarie: whereto the saieng of the poet giueth credit, in

<div class="sidenote">1446</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Summerset made regent of Norma&#x0304;die, and the Duke of Yorke discharged.</div>

<p>This yeare, after the deceasse of Henrie Chicheleie archbishop of Canturburie,
succ&eacute;eded Iohn Stafford in that s&eacute;e, being translated from Bath and Wels. He was
the thr&eacute;escore and one archbishop, as Polydor noteth. During the time of the
truce, Richard duke of Yorke and diuerse other capteins repaired into England, both
to visit their wiues, children, and fr&eacute;ends, and also to consult what should be doone,
if the truce ended. For the which cause a parlement was called, in the which it was
especiallie concluded, that by good foresight Normandie might be so furnished for
defense before the end of the truce, that the French king should take no aduantage
through want of timelie prouision: for it was knowne, that if a peace were not
concluded, the French king did prepare to imploie his whole puissance to make open
warre. H&eacute;erevpon monie was granted, an armie leuied, and the duke of Summerset
appointed to be regent of Normandie, and the duke of Yorke thereof discharged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorke appointed to the charge againe.</div>

<p>I haue s&eacute;ene in a register booke belonging sometime to the abbeie of saint Albons
that the duke of Yorke was established regent of France, after the deceasse of the
duke of Bedford, to continue in that office for the tearme of fiue yeares; which
being expired, he returned home, and was ioifullie receiued of the king with thanks
for his good seruice, as he had full well deserued in time of that his gouernement: and
further, that now when a new regent was to be chosen and sent ouer, to abide vpon
safegard of the countries beyond the seas as yet subiect to the English dominion, the
said duke of Yorke was eftsoones (as a man most m&eacute;et to supplie that roome) appointed
to go ouer againe, as regent of France with all his former allowances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The appointme&#x0304;t disappointed, and pointed to the marquesse of Suffolke.</div>

<p>But the duke of Summerset still maligning the duke of Yorkes aduancement, as he
had sought to hinder his dispatch at the first when he was sent ouer to be regent, as
before y&eacute;e haue heard: he likewise now wrought so, that the king reuoked his grant
made to the duke of Yorke for enioieng of that office the terme of other fiue y&eacute;eres,
and with helpe of William marquesse of Suffolke obteined that grant for himselfe.
Which malicious deling the duke of Yorke might so euill beare, that in the end the
heate of displeasure burst out into such a flame, as consumed at length not onelie both
those two noble personages, but also manie thousands of others, though in diuers
times and seasons, as in places hereafter (as occasion serueth) it shall more euidentlie
appeare. But now to returne to the parlement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The marques of Suffolks request.</div>

<p>The marques of Suffolke, supposing all men had as well liked his dooings (during
the time of his legation in France) as himselfe, the second daie of Iune in the first
session of this parlement in the higher house openlie, eloquentlie, and boldlie declared
his paine, trauell, and diligence susteined in his said legation, as well for the taking
and concluding an abstinence of warre, as in the making of the mariage; remembring
them also that the said truce expired the first of Aprill next, except a finall peace, or
a further truce were concluded in the meane season: and therefore he aduised them to
prouide and fores&eacute;e things necessarie for the warre (as though no concord should
succ&eacute;ed) least happilie the Frenchmen perceiuing them vnprouided, would take their
aduantage, and agr&eacute;e neither to peace nor amitie; saieng vnto them further, that
sith he had admonished the king and them according to his dutie, if anie thing happened
otherwise than well, he was thereof innocent and guiltlesse and had acquited himselfe
like a true and louing subiect, and a faithfull councellour, praieng the lords to
haue it in remembrance.</p>

<p>Likewise on the morow after, he descended into the common house, accompanied
with certeine lords, and there declared the same matter to the knights, citizens, and
burgesses, praieng the commons for his discharge, that as well all his dooings and proc&eacute;edings
in the kings affaires beyond the sea, as also his aduertisement and counsell opened
to the lords and commons now togither assembled, might be by the king and them inacted
and inrolled in the records of the parlement. Wherevpon the next daie after,
the speaker William Burghleie, and the companie of the lower house, repaired vnto
the kings presence, sitting amongst the lords of the vpper house, &amp; there humblie required
that the request of the marquesse might be granted. And so likewise the
lords made the like petition kn&eacute;eling on their kn&eacute;es, insomuch that the king condescended
to their desires: and so the labours, demeanours, diligences, and declarations
of the said marquesse, togither with the desires not onelie of the lords, but
also of the commons, as well for the honour of him and his posteritie, as for his
acquitall and discharge, were inacted and inrolled in the records of the parlement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The marques of Suffolke, ch&eacute;efest in fauour and authoritie with the king and qu&eacute;ene.</div>

<p>By the qu&eacute;enes meanes shortlie after also was the said marquesse aduanced so in
authoritie, that he ruled the king at his pleasure, and to his high preferment obteined
the wardships both of the bodie and lands of the countesse of Warwike, and
of the ladie Margaret sole heire to Iohn duke of Summerset, which ladie was afterward
moother to king Henrie the seauenth: and besides that, caused the king to
create Iohn de Fois, sonne vnto Gaston de Fois, earle of Longuile, and the Capdau
de Beufe earle of Kendall, which Iohn had married his n&eacute;ece, and by his procurement
the king elected to the order of the garter the said Gaston, and Iohn his sonne,
giuing to the sonne towards the maintenance of his degr&eacute;e, lands and castels, amounting
to the summe of one thousand pounds, which lands, name, and stile the issue
and line of the said earle of Kendall at this daie haue and inioy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The liberties of Norwich seized into the kings hands.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Indirect meanes to reforme wrongs.</div>

<p>These things being thus in dooing, the French king, s&eacute;eing that the towne of
Mans was not deliuered according to the appointment taken by force of the marriage,
raised an armie for to recouer the same. Whereof the king of England being aduertised
(least the breach of the truce should come by him) caused the towne to be
deliuered without anie force. This yeare was a great commotion in Norwich against
the prior of the place. At length the citizens opened the gates to the duke
of Norffolke, who came thither to appease the matter, though at the first they would
not suffer him to enter. The ch&eacute;efe offendors were (according to their demerits)
gr&eacute;euouslie punished and executed, and the maior was discharged of his office, and
sir Iohn Clifton was made gouernour there, vntil the king had restored the citizens
to their ancient liberties. This commotion was begun for certeine new exactions
which the prior claimed and tooke of the citizens, contrarie to their ancient fr&eacute;edome.
But herein a wrong taken for getting of right was worthilie corrected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drunkennese the ouerthrow of right and manhood.</div>

<p>&para; In the foure and twentith yeare of this kings reigne, the prior of Kilmaine appeached
the earle of Ormond of treason. For triall whereof the place of combat
was assigned in Smithfield, &amp; the barriers for the same there readie pitcht. Howbeit,
in the meane time a doctor of diuinitie, named maister Gilbert Worthington, parson
of saint Andrews in Holborne, and other honest men, made such sute with diligent
labour and paines-taking to the kings councell, that when the daie of combat approched,
the quarell was taken into the kings hands, and there ended. &para; In the
same yeare also, a certeine armourer was appeached of treason by a seruant of his
owne. For proofe whereof a daie was giuen them to fight in Smithfield, insomuch
that in conflict the said armourer was ouercome and slaine; but yet by misgouerning
of himselfe. For on the morow, when he should come to the field fresh and fasting,
his neighbours came to him, and gaue him wine and strong drinke in such excessiue
sort, that he was therewith distempered, and r&eacute;eled as he went, and so was slaine
without guilt. As for the false seruant, he liued not long vnpunished; for being
conuict of felonie in court of assise, he was iudged to be hanged, and so was, at
Tiburne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 25.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The description of the qu&eacute;ene.</div>

<p>Whilest the warres betw&eacute;ene the two nations of England &amp; France ceassed (by
occasion of the truce) the minds of men were not so quiet, but that such as were
bent to malicious reuenge, sought to compasse their prepensed purpose, not against
forren foes and enimies of their countrie, but against their owne countriemen, and
those that had deserued verie well of the common-wealth: and this speciallie for
ouermuch mildnesse in the king, who by his authoritie might haue ruled both parts,
and ordered all differences betwixt them, but that in d&eacute;ed he was thought too soft
for gouernor of a kingdome. The qu&eacute;ene contrariwise, a ladie of great wit, and no
lesse courage, desirous of honour, and furnished with the gifts of reason, policie, and
wisdome; but yet sometime (according to hir kind) when she had b&eacute;ene fullie bent
on a matter, suddenlie like a weather cocke, mutable and turning.</p>

<p>This ladie disdaining that hir husband should be ruled rather than rule, could
not abide that the duke of Gloucester should doo all things concerning the order
of weightie affaires, least it might be said, that she had neither wit nor stomach,
which would permit and suffer hir husband, being of most perfect age, like a yoong
pupill to be gouerned by the direction of an other man. Although this toy entered
first into hir braine thorough hir owne imagination, yet was she pricked forward to
the matter both by such of hir husbands counsell, as of long time had borne malice
to the duke for his plainesse vsed in declaring their vntruth (as partlie ye haue
heard) and also by counsell from king Reiner hir father, aduising that she and the
king should take vpon them the rule of the realme, and not to be kept vnder, as
wards and mastered orphanes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;ene taketh vpon hir the gouernement, and dischargeth the duke of Glocester.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The faint quarell piked to the duke of Glocester.</div>

<p>What n&eacute;edeth manie words? The qu&eacute;ene persuaded by these meanes, first of all
excluded the duke of Glocester from all rule and gouernance, not prohibiting such
as she knew to be his mortall foes to inuent and imagine causes and gr&eacute;efs against
him and his, insomuch that by hir procurement, diuerse noblemen conspired against
him. Of the which diuerse writers affirme the marquesse of Suffolke, and the duke
of Buckingham to be the ch&eacute;efe, not vnprocured by the cardinall of Winchester,
and the archbishop of Yorke. Diuerse articles were laid against him in open councell,
and in especiallie one; That he had caused men adiudged to die, to be put to other
execution, than the law of the land assigned. Suerlie the duke verie well learned in
the law ciuill, detesting malefactors, and punishing offenses in seueritie of iustice,
gat him hatred of such as feared condigne reward for their wicked dooings. And
although the duke sufficientlie answered to all things against him obiected: yet because
his death was determined, his wisedome and innocencie nothing auailed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A parlement at saint Edmundesburie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Glocester suddenlie murthered.</div>

<p>But to auoid danger of tumult that might be raised, if a prince so well beloued of
the people should be openlie executed; his enimies determined to worke their feats in
his destruction, yer he should haue anie warning. For effecting whereof, a parlement
was summoned to be kept at Berrie, whither resorted all the p&eacute;eres of the realme, and
amongst them the duke of Glocester; which on the second daie of the session was
by the lord Beaumont, then high constable of England, accompanied with the duke
of Buckingham, and others arrested, apprehended, and put in ward, and all his
seruants sequestred from him, and thirtie two of the ch&eacute;efe of his retinue were sent to
diuerse prisons, to the great admiration of the people. The duke the night after he
was thus committed to prison, being the foure and twentith of Februarie, was found
dead in his bed, and his bodie shewed to the lords and commons, as though he had died
a palsie, or of an imposteme.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Edw. Hall.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">A pardon at a pinch.</div>

<p>But all indifferent persons (as saith Hall) might well vnderstand that he died of some
violent death. Some iudged him to be strangled, some affirme that an hot spit was
put in at his fundament, other write that he was smouldered betw&eacute;ene two featherbeds,
and some haue affirmed that he died of verie gr&eacute;efe, for that he might not come openlie
to his answer. His dead corpse was conueied to saint Albons, and there buried. After
his death, none of his seruants suffered: although fiue of them, to wit, sir Roger
Chamberline knight, Middleton, Herbert, Arteise esquiers, and Richard Nedham
gentleman, were arreigned, condemned, and drawen to Tiborne, where they were
hanged, let downe quicke, and stripped to haue b&eacute;ene bowelled and quartered: but
the marques of Suffolke comming at that instant brought their pardons, shewed the
same openlie, and so their liues were saued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dukes of Glocester vnfortunate.</div>

<p>Some thinke that the name and title of Glocester hath b&eacute;ene vnluckie to diuerse,
which for their honours haue b&eacute;ene erected by creation of princes to that stile and
dignitie, as Hugh Spenser, Thomas of Woodstoke, sonne to king Edward the third,
and this duke Humfreie: which thr&eacute;e persons by miserable death finished their daies;
and after them king Richard the third also, duke of Glocester in ciuill warre slaine.
So that this name duke of Glocester is taken for an vnhappie stile, as the prouerbe
speaketh of Seians horsse, whose rider was euer vnhorssed, &amp; whose possessor was
euer brought to miserie. But suerlie, by the pitifull death of this noble duke and
politike gouernour, the publike wealth of the realme came to great decaie, as by
sequele here may more at large appeare.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<p>[Oft times it hapneth that a man in quenching of smoke, burneth his fingers in the
fire:] so the qu&eacute;ene in casting how to k&eacute;epe hir husband in honor, and hir selfe in
authoritie, in making awaie of this noble man, brought that to passe, which she had
most cause to haue feared, which was the deposing of hir husband, &amp; the decaie of
the house of Lancaster, which of likelihood had not chanced if this duke had liued:
for then durst not the duke of Yorke haue attempted to set foorth his title to the
crowne, as he afterwards did, to the great trouble of the realme, and destruction of
king Henrie, and of manie other noble men beside. This is the opinion of men, but
Gods iudgements are vnsearchable, against whose decr&eacute;e and ordinance preuaileth no
humane counsell.</p>

<p>But to conclude of this noble duke: he was an vpright and politike gouernour,
bending all his indeuours to the aduancement of the common-wealth, verie louing to
the poore commons, and so beloued of them againe; learned, wise, full of courtesie;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
void of pride and ambition (a vertue rare in personages of such high estate) but
where it is most commendable. But sith the praise of this noble man deserueth a
large discourse, and m&eacute;et for such as haue cunning how to handle the same (sith the
ornaments of his mind were both rare &amp; admirable, the feats of chiualrie by him
commensed and atchiued valiant and fortunate, his grauitie in counsell, and soundnesse
of policie profound and singular, all which with a traine of other excellent
properties linked togither, require a man of manifold gifts to aduance them according
to their dignitie) I refer the readers vnto maister Foxes booke of Acts and Monuments.
Onelie this I ad, that in respect of his noble indowments, and his demeanor full of
decencie, which he daily vsed, it s&eacute;emeth he might well haue giuen this pretty

<p>In this six and twentith yeare of the reigne of this king, but in the first of the rule

desire of the qu&eacute;ene, was erected to the title and dignitie of duke of Suffolke, which

the king to be no ruler, but the whole burthen of the realme to rest in direction of the
qu&eacute;ene, &amp; the duke of Suffolke, began secretlie to allure his friends of the nobilitie;
and priuilie declared vnto them his title and right to the crowne, and likewise did he
to certeine wise gouernours of diuerse cities and townes. Which attempt was so
politikelie handled, and so secretlie kept, that prouision to his purpose was readie,
before his purpose was openlie published; and his friends opened themselues, yer the

Iohn Duke of Lancaster, descended of an honorable linage, but borne in hast,
more noble in blood than notable in learning, hautie in stomach, and high of countenance,
rich aboue measure, but not verie liberall, disdainefull to his kin, and
dreadfull to his louers, preferring monie before friendship, manie things beginning
and few performing, sauing in malice and mischiefe; his insatiable couetousnesse
and hope of long life made him both to forget God, his prince, and himselfe. Of the
getting of his goods both by power legantine, and spirituall briberie, I will not speake;
but the k&eacute;eping of them, which he chiefelie gathered for ambitious purpose, was both
great losse to his naturall prince and natiue countrie: for his hidden riches might
haue well holpen the king, and his secret treasure might haue relieued the communaltie,

of the countrie where he was borne, a man for his wit and actiuitie admitted into the
order of the garter, tooke by scaling suddenlie in the night of the euen of our ladie
day in Lent, a towne on the frontiers of Normandie, belonging to the duke of
Britaine called Fougiers, spoiling the same, and killing the inhabitants. The duke of
Britaine, being hereof aduertised, sent word by the bishop of Reimes to the French
king, bes&eacute;eching him of his aid and counsell in the matter.</p>

<p>The French king foorthwith sent his caruer Iohn Hauart, and Iohn Cosinet one of
the maisters of his requests to the king of England: and to the duke of Summerset
he dispatched Peter de Fonteins the maister of his horsse. To which messengers
answer was made aswell by the king as the duke, that the fact was doone without
their knowledge. And for the truce to be kept, and not onelie restitution, but also
amends to be made to the duke of Britaine, a daie of diet was appointed to be kept at
Louuiers, where the commissioners on both parts being assembled, the Frenchmen
demanded amends, with no small recompense. The Englishmen answered, that
without offense, nothing by iustice ought to be satisfied; affirming the dooing of sir
Francis Sureinnes to be onelie his act, without consent either of the king of England,
or of the duke of Summerset his lieutenant and regent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Po&#x0304;t de Larch taken by the Fre&#x0304;chmen by a subtill sleight.</div>

<p>But whiles with long delaie they talked of this matter at Louuiers, certeine French
men by aduertisement of a wagoner of Louuiers, vnderstanding that the towne of
Pont de Larch was but slenderlie manned; the wagoner laded his wagon and passed
forward, hauing in his companie two strong varlets clad like carpentars, with great
axes on their shoulders. And hereto le seineur de Bresse with a chosen companie of
men of armes, lodged himselfe in ambushment n&eacute;ere to the gate of S. Andrew, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
capteine Floquet, accompanied with sir Iames de Cleremont, and another great companie
priuilie lurked vnder a wood toward Louuiers. When all things were appointed for
the purpose, earlie in a morning about the beginning of October, the wagoner came
to the gate, and called the porter by name, praieng him to open the gate, that he
might passe to Rone, and returne againe the same night.</p>

<p>The porter (which well knew the voice of his customer) tooke little h&eacute;ed to the
other two companions, and so opened the one gate, and sent another fellow of his to
open the formost gate. When the chariot was on the draw-bridge betw&eacute;ene both the
gates, the chariot-maister gaue the porter monie, and for the nonce let one p&eacute;ece fall
on the ground: and while the porter stooped to take it vp, the wagoner with his dagger
stroke him in at his throat, so that he cried for no helpe, and the two great lubbers
slue the other porters, and with their axes cut the axeltr&eacute;e of the wagon, so that the
draw-bridge could not be shortlie drawen vp. This doone they made a signe to capteine
Floquet, which with all sp&eacute;ed entered the towne, slue and tooke all the Englishmen:
and amongst other, the lord Fauconbridge capteine of the said towne was
taken prisoner. The losse of this place was of no small importance, being the verie
keie and passage ouer the riuer of Seine, from France into Normandie, being distant
from Rone onelie foure leagues.</p>

<p>When request was made to haue it restored againe to the Englishmen, answer was
made, that if they restored vnto the duke of Britaine, the towne of Fougiers, with
condigne amends for the damages doone there, the towne of Pont Larch should then
be againe deliuered, or else not. And shortlie after, in hope of like successe the
French king assembled an armie, and diuiding the same in thr&eacute;e parts, got by surrender
(after sundrie assaults, and losse of diuerse of his men) the townes of Louuiers, &amp;
Gerborie, whereof William Harper was capteine. Also the towne, castell, and great
tower of Verneueill in Perch were rendered into the French kings hands, after twentie
daies of respit granted, to s&eacute;e if rescues would haue come. The French writers affirme
the towne to be taken by assault.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The warres renewed befor the end of the truce.</div>

<p>Thus was the warre renewed before the terme of truce fullie expired, &amp; the English
capteins brought to their wits end, what with appeasing dalie rumors within the
townes; and what with studie how to recouer castels lost and taken: for while they
studied how to k&eacute;epe and defend one place, foure or fiue other turned to the French
part. The chiefe cause of which reuolting was, for that it was blowen abroad thorough
France, how the realme of England, after the death of the duke of Glocester by the
seuerall factions of princes was diuided in two parts; and that William de la Poole
latelie created duke of Suffolke, and diuerse other, which were the occasion of the
said duke of Glocesters death, vexed and oppressed the poore people, so that mens
minds were not intentiue to outward affaires: but all their studie giuen to k&eacute;epe off
wrongs offered at home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A rebellion in Ireland.</div>

<p>The king little regarding the matter, &amp; the qu&eacute;ene led by euill counsell, rather
furthered such mischiefes as dailie began to grow by ciuil discord, than sought to reforme
them: so that the Normans and Gascoignes vnderstanding in what state things
stood here, turned to the French part, as hereafter it may appeare. About the same
time also, began a new rebellion in Ireland; but Richard duke of Yorke being
thither to appease the same, so asswaged the furie of the wild and sauage people
there, that he wan him such fauour amongst them, as could neuer be separated
from him and his linage, which in the sequele of this historie may more plainelie
appeare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rone y&eacute;elded to the Frenchmen.</div>

<p>The Frenchmen, hauing perfect vnderstanding of the vnreadinesse of the realme
of England, displaied their banners, and set foorth their armies, and in short space
got (by y&eacute;elding) Constance, Gisors, castell Galliard, Ponteau de Mere, saint Lo,
Festampe, Newcastell, Tonque, Mauleon, Argenton, Lisieux, and diuerse other townes
and places within the countrie of Normandie. Likewise in Guien was the towne of
Maulisson rendered to the earle of Fois. These townes were not y&eacute;elded voluntarilie
by the English souldiers: but they were compelled thereto by the inhabitants of the
townes, which hauing intelligence of the f&eacute;eble estate of the realme of England, rose
against the capteins, opened the gates to the enimies, or constreined them to render
vpon composition. By which inforcement was the rich citie of Rone deliuered: for
suerlie the duke of Summerset and the earle of Shrewesburie had well kept that citie,
if they had b&eacute;ene no more vexed with the citizens, than they were with their enimies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Harflue besieged.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Thomas Curson.</div>

<p>For after that the French king had giuen summons to the citie, the inhabitants
streightwaies did not onelie deuise which waie they might betraie the citie, but also
put on armor, and rebelled openlie against their capteins: who perceiuing the vntruth
of them, and their owne danger, retired into the castell or palace, where (for a certeine
space) with arrowes &amp; handguns they sore molested the vntrue citizens. But at length,
vnderstanding the great puissance of the French king at hand, and despairing of all
aid and succour, they y&eacute;elded vpon condition; that with all their goods and armour
they should safelie depart to Caen, and that certeine townes should be deliuered by
a day. And till the same townes were rendred, the earle of Shrewesburie and the lord
Butler, sonne to the earle of Ormond, were left behind as pledges, which were sent
to the castell of Eureux, bicause they sore feared the malice of the citizens of Rone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Harflue y&eacute;elded to the French.</div>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 28.</div>

<p>The Frenchmen, following the successe in hand, came to Harflue, and fiercelie
assaulted the walles: but by the high prowesse and vndanted valiancie of the capteine,
sir Thomas Curson, they were to their great losse manfullie by him repelled, and
beaten. The Frenchmen learning wit by this great perill, left their scaling, and
deuised dailie how to batter the walles, &amp; make the breaches reasonable for them to
enter. This siege long continued to the great losse of both parties. When sir Thomas
Curson saw no likelihood of gaine, but great app&eacute;erance of present losse, he fell at
composition with the enimies, and so departed with all his goods. After which towne
rendered, the fortresse of Hunflue was vpon like composition y&eacute;elded. And beside
these townes surrendred in Normandie, the duke of Britaine recouered againe Fougiers,
saint Iames de Beuuron, and diuerse other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1450</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Thomas Kiriell with a new band into France.</div>

<p>In the meane season the king of England sent into Normandie (with a new supplie
of a thousand fiue hundred men) a right valiant capteine called sir Thomas Kiriell,
who ioining himselfe with other English capteins recouered the townes of Lisieux
and Valongnes, and hauing with him power sufficient (as he tooke it) to k&eacute;epe the
fields, he departed the twelfe of Aprill from Valongnes, meaning to passe towards
Baieux, and after to Caen. But the eight&eacute;enth daie of the same moneth, he was
incountred at a place called Formignie betwixt Carenten and Baieux, by the earle of
Cleremont, &amp; other Frenchmen with Scots. At the first onset, the Englishmen receiued
their enimies with such manhood, that the Frenchmen were driuen backe, and
the Englishmen tooke from them two culuerings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Englishmen ouerthrowne at Formigne.</div>

<p>But yet in the end, by the comming of the constable of France, Arthur de Britaine
earle of Richmond, who brought two hundred or twelue score men of armes, and an
eight hundred archers or demilances, the Englishmen were discomfited, put to flight,
and slaine to the number of thr&eacute;e thousand, seauen hundred, thr&eacute;e score and thirt&eacute;ene
as Enguerant noteth, beside prisoners, of whome there were diuerse personages of

<div class="sidenote">Caen besieged and y&eacute;elded to the French.</div>

<p>After this ouerthrow obteined, the French king assembled an armie roiall, and
comming before Caen, besieged it on all sides: and after making his approches, fiercelie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>assaulted the walles. But the duke of Summerset, and the other capteins within
the towne, manfullie withstood their enimies, shewing both force and great policie
in defending and beating backe the assailants. The French king, perceiuing he could
not preuaile that waie, sent for all his great ordinance to Paris, which being brought,
he dailie shot at the wals, and did some hurt: but to the castell which stood on a
rocke, and in it a dungeon vnable to be beaten downe, he did no harme at all.</p>

<p>Though the duke of Summerset was the kings lieutenant, yet sir Dauid Hall, as
capteine of this towne for his maister the duke of Yorke owner therof, tooke vpon
him the ch&eacute;efe charge. Sir Robert V&eacute;er was capteine of the castell, and sir Henrie
Radford capteine of the dungeon. Dailie the shot was great, but more terrible than
hurtfull: sauing on a daie a stone shot into the towne, fell betw&eacute;ene the duchesse of
Summerset, and hir children, which being amazed with this chance, besought hir
husband kn&eacute;eling on hir kn&eacute;es, to haue mercie and compassion of his small infants,
and that they might be deliuered out of the towne in safegard. Which intretie made
with teares and submission, what eare could but listen to, what heart but yerne at;
vnlessse both eare and heart were made of flint or marble, or hewen out of a hard
rocke, and so void of all passions, of all remorse, of all affections belonging to humanitie?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The irreconciliable hate betw&eacute;ene the two dukes.</div>

<p>The duke pitifull, mooued with the sorrow of his wife, and loue of his children,
rendered the towne against the mind of sir Dauid Hall, whose counsell and faithfull
diligence (in acquiring himselfe to answer the trust committed to him by his maister)
if others had followed; the French had susteined more trauell and losse, yer they
should haue so easilie atteined their purpose. The conditions of the surrender were,
that the duke of Summerset and his might depart in safegard with all their goods and
substance. Sir Dauid Hall with diuerse of his trustie fr&eacute;ends departed to Chierburgh,
and from thence sailed into Ireland to the duke of Yorke, making relation to him of
all these dooings, which thing kindled so great a rancor in the dukes heart and stomach,
that he neuer left persecuting the duke of Summerset, vntill he had brought him to
his fatall end &amp; confusion. Such is the nature of rancor and malice, of wrath and anger,
which furthereth the hands euen of weaklings, on them to wreake their t&eacute;ene,
with whome they are offended and pricked to reuengment, as the poet saith:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>After the obteining of Caen, the earle of Cleremont besieged the citie of Lisieux,

end deliuered that towne, vpon condition, that he and his people might depart to
Chierburgh. Then was Falais besieged, whereof were capteins for the earle of Shrewesburie
(that was the owner) Andrew Trollop, and Thomas Cotton esquiers, who being
in despaire of all succors, agr&eacute;ed to deliuer it vpon two conditions. The one was,
that the earle their maister, which remained in pledge for the performance of certeine
appointments, concluded at the deliuerie of Rone (as ye haue hard) should be set at
libertie. The other, that if they were not rescued within twelue daies, that then they

and munition serued, defended the towne right manfullie: but without hope of
repaire, consumed, and he els destitute of all comfort and aid, vpon a reasonable composition,
y&eacute;elded the towne, and went to Calis, where the duke of Summerset and
manie other Englishmen then soiorned. Thus was Normandie lost cl&eacute;erelie out of the
Englishmens hands, after it had continued in their possession the space of thirtie yeares

<p>In this duchie were an hundred strong townes and fortresses, able to be kept and
holden, beside them which were destroied by the warres; and in the same is one archbishoprike,
and six bishopriks. Some saie that the Englishmen were not of puissance
either to man the townes, as they should haue b&eacute;ene; or to inhabit the countrie, which
was the cause they could not k&eacute;epe it. Other saie, that the duke of Summerset for
his owne peculiar lucre, kept not halfe the number of souldiours for which he was appointed
and allowed, but put the wages in his purse. But the ch&eacute;efe and onelie cause
vndoubtedlie, was the diuision within the realme, euerie great man desiring rather to
be reuenged on his foe at home, than on the common enimie abroad, as by that which
followeth you may plainelie perceiue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 29.</div>

<p>[For whilest the French thus triumphed in Normandie, thr&eacute;e cruell enimies among

malice and pride, with insatiable couetise in the states both spirituall and temporall:

<p>H&eacute;erewith perceiuing how (through want of prouident wisedome in the gouernour)

exclamation against the duke of Suffolke, charging him to be the onelie cause of the

the verie occasion of losse of Normandie, the swallower vp of the kings treasure, the

a full appearance. In the which session the commons of the nether house put vp to
the king and the lords manie articles of treason, misprision, and euill demeanor,
against the duke of Suffolke: the effect whereof with his answers h&eacute;ere insueth.</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Articles_proponed_by_the_commons_against_the_duke_of_Suffolke" id="Articles_proponed_by_the_commons_against_the_duke_of_Suffolke">Articles proponed by the commons against the duke of Suffolke.</a></h2>


<p>1 First they alleged that he had traitorouslie excited, prouoked, and councelled
Iohn earle of Dunois bastard of Orleance, Bertram lord Presignie, William Cosinet,
enimies to the king, and fr&eacute;ends and ambassadours to Charles, calling himselfe French
king, to enter into this realme; and to leauie warre against the king and his people, to
the intent to destroie the king and his fr&eacute;ends, and to make Iohn his sonne king of
this realme, marieng him to Margaret, sole heire to Iohn duke of Summerset, pretending
and declaring hir to be next heire inheritable to the crowne, for lacke of issue,
of the kings bodie lawfullie begotten.</p>

<p>2 Item, the said duke, being of the kings priuie and n&eacute;ere councell, allured by
great rewards and faire promises, made by the said earle of Dunois, caused the king
to deliuer and set at libertie, Charles duke of Orleance, enimie to the king, and the
kings noble father: which deliuerance was prohibited by expresse words, in the last
will of the kings most victorious father.</p>

<p>3 Item, that before the departing of the said duke of Orleance, the aforenamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
duke of Suffolke traitorouslie fast cleauing to Charles called the French king,
counselled, prouoked, and intised the said duke of Orleance, to mooue the same
king to make warre against England, both in France and Normandie. According
to which procurement &amp; counsell, the said French king hath recouered the whole
realme of France, and all the duchie of Normandie, and taken prisoners the earle of
Shrewesburie, the lord Fauconbridge, and manie other valiant capteins. &para; These
thr&eacute;e articles afornamed he denied, either for fact or thought.]</p>

<p>4 Further it was alleged, that he being ambassadour to the king of England, to
Charles calling himselfe the French king, promised to Reiner king of Sicill, and to
Charles d'Angiers his brother, enimies to the king, the release of Aniou, with the
deliuerance of the countie of Maine, and the city of Maunt or Mans, without the
knowledge of the other ambassadours with him accompanied. Which promise, after
his returne, he caused to be performed, to the kings disinheritance and loss irrecouerable,
and to the strength of his enimies, and f&eacute;eblishment of the duchie of
Normandie. &para; To this article he answered, that his commission was to conclude,
and doo all things according to his discretion, for the obteining of a peace: &amp; bicause
without deliuerie of those countries, he perceiued that the truce could not be obteined,
he agr&eacute;ed to the release and deliuerance of them.</p>

<p>5 Also they had great cause to iudge by the sequele, that the said duke being in
France in the kings seruice, and one of the priuiest of his councell there, traitorouslie
declared and opened to the capteins and conductors of warre, apperteining
to the kings enimies, the kings counsell, purueiance of his armies, furniture of his
townes, &amp; all other ordinances, whereby the kings enimies (instructed aforehand by
his traitorous information) haue gotten townes and fortresses, and the king by that
meanes depriued of his inheritance.</p>

<p>6 Item, the said duke declared to the earle of Dunois, to the lord Presignie, and
William Cosinet ambassadours for the French king lieng in London, the priuities of
the kings councell, both for the prouision of further warre, and also for the defense
of the duchie of Normandie: by the disclosing whereof, the Frenchmen knowing
the king secrets, defeated the kings appointments, and they obteined their
purpose.</p>

<p>7 Item, that the said duke, at such time as the king sent ambassadours to the
French king, for the intreating of peace, traitorouslie before their comming to the
French court, certified king Charles of their commission, authoritie, and instructions:
by reason whereof, neither peace nor amitie succ&eacute;eded, and the kings inheritance
lost, and by his enimies possessed.</p>

<p>8 Item, the said duke said openlie in the Star-chamber before the lords of the
councell, that he had as high a place in the councell-house of the French king, as he
had there: and was as well trusted there as here, and could remooue from the French
king the priuiest man of his councell, if he would.</p>

<p>9 Item, when armies haue b&eacute;ene prepared, and souldiers readie waged to passe
ouer the sea, to deale with the kings enimies: the said duke, corrupted by rewards
of the French king, hath restreined &amp; staid the said armies to passe any further.</p>

<p>10 Item, the said duke being ambassadour for the king, comprised not in the
league (as the kings alies) neither the king of Aragon, neither the duke of Britaine:
but suffered them to be comprised on the contrarie part. By reason whereof,
the old amitie of the k. of Aragon is estranged from this realme, and the duke of
Britaine became enimie to the same: Giles his brother, the kings sure fr&eacute;end, cast in
strong prison, and there lie to end his dais.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All these obiections he vtterlie denied, or faintlie auoided: but none fullie excused.
Diuerse other crimes were laid to his charge, as inriching himselfe with the kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
goods and lands, gathering togither and making a monopolie of offices, f&eacute;es, wards,
and farmes, by reason whereof, the kings estate was greatlie diminished and decaied,
and he and his kin highlie exalted &amp; inriched: with manie other points, which
bicause they be not notable nor of great force or strength, I omit and ouerpasse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Suffolke co&#x0304;mitted to the Tower.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Blewbeard capteine of the rebels.</div>

<p>The qu&eacute;ene, which intierlie loued the duke, doubting some commotion and trouble
to arise, if he were let go vnpunished, caused him for a colour to be committed to
the Tower: where he remained not past a moneth, but was againe deliuered and restored
to the kings fauour, as much as euer he was before. This dooing so much displeased
the people, that if politike prouision had not b&eacute;ene, great misch&eacute;efe had immediatlie
insued. For the commons in sundrie places of the realme assembled
togither in great companies, and chose to them a capteine, whom they called Blewbeard:
but yer they had attempted anie enterprise, their leaders were apprehended;
&amp; so the matter pacified without anie hurt committed.</p>

<p>After this outrage thus asswaged, the parlement was adiourned to Leicester,
whither came the king and qu&eacute;ene in great estate, and with them the duke of Suffolke
as ch&eacute;efe councellour. The commons of the lower house, not forgetting their
old grudge, besought the king, that such persons as assented to the release of
Aniou, and deliuerance of Maine, might be dulie punished. And to be priuie to
that fact, they accused as principall, the duke of Suffolke, with Iohn bishop of
Salisburie, and sir Iames Fines, lord Saie, and diuerse others. When the king perceiued
that there was no remedie to appease the peoples furie by anie colourable
waies, shortlie to pacifie so long an hatred, he first sequestred the lord Saie being
treasuror of England, and other the dukes adherents from their offices and roomes,
and after banished the duke of Suffolke, as the abhorred tode and common noiance
of the whole realme, for tearme of fiue yeares, meaning by this exile to appease the
malice of the people for the time, and after (when the matter should be forgotten)
to reuoke him home againe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The wretched death of the duke of Suffolke.</div>

<p>But Gods iustice would not that so vngratious a person should so escape: for
when he shipped in Suffolke, intending to transport himselfe ouer into France, he
was incountered with a ship of warre, apperteining to the duke of Excester, constable
of the Tower of London, called the Nicholas of the Tower. The capteine
of that barke with small fight entered into the dukes ship, and perceiuing his person
present, brought him to Douer road, and there on the one side of a cocke bote caused
his head to be striken off, and left his bodie with the head lieng there on the sands.
Which corps being there found by a chapleine of his, was conueied to Wingfield college
in Suffolke, and there buried. This end had William de la Poole duke of Suffolke,
as men iudge by Gods prouidence; for that he had procured the death of that
good duke of Glocester, as before is partlie touched.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iacke Cades rebellion in Kent.</div>

<p>Soone after an other disquiet befell here. Those that fauoured the duke of Yorke,
and wished the crowne vpon his head, for that (as they iudged) he had more right
thereto than he that ware it, procured a commotion in Kent on this manner. A certeine
yoong man of a goodlie stature and right pregnant of wit, was intised to take
vpon him the name of Iohn Mortimer coosine to the duke of Yorke (although his name
was Iohn Cade, or (of some) Iohn Mend-all) [an Irishman as Polychronicon saith]
and not for a small policie, thinking by that surname, that those which fauoured the
house of the earle of March would be assistant to him. And so in d&eacute;ed it came to
passe (as in such cases there is no br&eacute;eder of a broile but he shall find adherents enow,
no lesse forward to further his pernicious enterprise by their foolehardines, than himselfe
was in the plot of his deuise) though in fine (as it is the vnluckie lot of such
tumults) their attempts were withstood, and their offense dulie rewarded, as in processe
of the storie shall more at large appeare; according to the wisemans sentence:</p>

<p>This capteine assembling a great companie of tall personages, assured them, that
the enterprise which he tooke in hand, was both honourable to God and the king, and
profitable to the whole realme. For if either by force or policie they might get the
king and qu&eacute;ene into their hands, he would cause them to be honourablie vsed, and
take such order for the punishing and reforming of the misdemeanours of their bad
councellours, that neither fift&eacute;ens should hereafter be demanded, nor once anie impositions
or taxes be spoken of. The Kentish people mooued at these persuasions
&amp; other faire promises of reformation, in good order of battell (though not in great
number) came with their capteine vnto the plaine of Blackeheath, betw&eacute;ene Eltham
and Gr&eacute;enewich, and there kept the field more than a month, pilling the countrie
about; to whome the citie of London at that time was verie fauourable. &para; And the

shadowed vnder a cloke of good meaning (though his intent nothing so) he sent vnto
the king an humble supplication, affirming that his comming was not against his

suckers of his purse, and robbers of his subjects; parciall to their fr&eacute;ends, and extreame

<p>1 Inprimis, it is openlie noised that Kent should be destroied with a roiall power,
&amp; made a wild forrest, for the death of the duke of Suffolke, of which the commons
of Kent thereof were neuer giltie.</p>

<p>2 Item, the king is stirred to liue onelie on his commons, and other men to haue
the reuenues of the crowne, the which hath caused pouertie in his excellencie, and
great paiments of the people, now late to the king granted in his parlement.</p>

<p>3 Item, that the lords of his roiall bloud b&eacute;ene put from his dailie presence, and
other meane persons of lower nature exalted and made ch&eacute;efe of his priuie councell,
the which stoppeth matters of wrongs done in the realme from his excellent audience,
and maie not be redressed as law will; but if bribes and gifts be messengers to the
hands of the said councell.</p>

<p>4 Item, the people of this realme be not paid of debts owing for stuffe and purueiance
taken to the vse of the kings houshold, in vndooing of the said people, and the
poore commons of the realme.</p>

<p>5 Item, the kings meniall seruants of houshold, and other persons, asken dailie
goods and lands, of impeached or indicted of treason, the which the king granteth
anon, yer they so indangered be conuicted. The which causeth the receiuers thereof
to inforce labours and meanes applied to the death of such people, so appeached or
indicted, by subtill meanes, for couetise of the said grants: and the people so impeached
or indicted, though it be vntrue, maie not be committed to the law for their
deliuerance, but held still in prison, to their vttermost vndooing &amp; destruction, for
couetise of goods.</p>

<p>6 Item, though diuerse of the poore people and commons of the realme, haue
neuer so great right, truth, and perfect title to their land: yet by vntrue claime of
infeoffement made vnto duierse states, gentles, and the kings meniall seruants in
maintenances against the right, the true owners dare not hold, claime, nor pursue
their right.</p>

<p>7 Item, it is noised by common voices, that the kings lands in France b&eacute;ene
aliened and put awaie from the crowne, and his lords and people there destroied with
vntrue meanes of treason; of which it is desired, inquiries thorough all the realme to
be made how and by whome; &amp; if such traitors maie be found giltie, them to haue
execution of law without anie pardon, in example of others.</p>

<p>8 Item, collectors of the fift&eacute;enth penie in Kent be greatlie vexed and hurt, in
paieng great summes of monie in the excheker, to sue out a writ called Quorum nomina,
for the alowance of the barons of the ports, which now is desired, that hereafter
in the lieu of the collectors, the barons aforesaid maie sue it out for their ease at their
owne costs.</p>

<p>9 Item, the shiriffes and vndershiriffes let to farme their offices and bailiwickes,
taking great suertie therefore, the which causeth extortions doone by them and by
their bailiffes to the people.</p>

<p>10 Item, simple and poore people that vse not hunting, be greatlie oppressed by
indictements feined &amp; doone by the said shiriffes, vndershiriffes, bailiffes, and other of
their assent, to cause their increase for paieng of their said farme.</p>

<p>11 Item, they returne in names of inquests in writing into diuerse courts of the
king not summoned nor warned, where through the people dailie l&eacute;ese great summes
of monie, well nigh to the vttermost of their vndooing: and make leuie of amercements
called the gr&eacute;ene wax, more in summes of monie than can be found due of record in
the kings books.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>12 Item, the ministers of the court of Douer in Kent vex and arrest diuerse people
thorough all the shire out of Castle ward, passing their bounds and libertie vsed of
old time, by diuerse subtill and vntrue meanes and actions falselie feined, taking
great f&eacute;es at their lust in great hurt of the people on all the shire of Kent.</p>

<p>13 Item, the people of the said shire of Kent, maie not haue their fr&eacute;e election
in the choosing of knights of the shire: but letters b&eacute;ene sent from diuerse estates to
the great rulers of all the countrie, the which imbraceth their tenants and other people
by force to choose other persons than the co&#x0304;mons will is.</p>

<p>14 Item, whereas knights of the shire should choose the king collectors indifferentlie
without any bribe taking, they haue sent now late to diuerse persons, notifieng them
to be collectors: wherevpon gifts and bribes be taken, &amp; so the collectors office is
bought and sold extortionouslie at the knights lust.</p>

<p>15 Item, the people be sore vexed in costs and labour, called to the sessions of peace
in the said shire, appearing from the furthest and vttermost part of the west vnto the
east; the which causeth to some men fiue daies iournie: wherevpon they desire the
said appearance to be diuided into two parts; the which one part, to appeare in one
place; an other part, in an other place; in rel&eacute;euing of the gr&eacute;euances and intollerable
labours &amp; vexations of the said people.</p>

<p>Inprimis, desireth the capteine of the commons, the welfare of our souereigne lord

lord, and of all the true lords of his councell, he to take in all his demaines, that he
maie reigne like a king roiall, according as he is borne our true and christian king
annointed: and whoso will saie the contrarie, we all will liue and die in the quarell as
his true liege men.</p>

<p>Item, desireth the said capteine, that he will auoid all the false progenie and
affinitie of the duke of Suffolke, the which b&eacute;ene openlie knowne, and they to be
punished after the custome and law of this land, and to take about his noble person
the true lords of his roiall blood of this his realme, that is to saie, the high and
mightie prince the duke of Yorke, late exiled from our said souereigne lords presence
(by the motion and stirring of the traitorous and false disposed the duke of Suffolke
and his affinitie) and the mightie princes &amp; dukes of Excester, Buckingham, and
Norffolke, and all the earles and barons of this land: and then shall he be the richest
king christian.</p>

<p>Item, desireth the said capteine and commons punishment vnto the false traitors,
the which contriued and imagined the death of the high, mightfull and excellent
prince the duke of Glocester, the which is too much to rehearse; the which duke
was proclamed as traitor. Vpon the which quarell, we purpose all to liue and die
vpon that it is false.</p>

<p>Item, the duke of Excester, our holie father the cardinall, the noble prince the
duke of Warwike, and also the realme of France, the duchie of Normandie, Gascoigne,
and Guion, Aniou, and Maine, were deliuered and lost by the meanes of the said
traitors: and our true lords, knights, and esquiers, and manie a good yeoman lost and
sold yer they went, the which is great pitie to heare, of the great and gr&eacute;euous losse
to our souereigne lord and his realme.</p>

<p>Item, desireth the said capteine and commons, that all extortions vsed dailie among
the common people, might be laid downe, that is to saie, the gr&eacute;ene wax; the which
is falselie vsed, to the perpetuall destruction of the kings true commons of Kent.
Also the kings Bench, the which is too gr&eacute;efefull to the shire of Kent, without proui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>sion

commons, without the br&eacute;efe prouision of our said souereigne lord and his true

<div class="sidenote">King Henrie went against the Kentishmen with a great power.</div>

<p>These billes when the councell had well perused, they did not onelie disalow and
condemne them and the authors, as proud and presumptuous; but also persuaded
the king rather to suppresse those rebels by force, than by faire promises. Wherevpon
the king remoued from Westminster vnto Gr&eacute;enewich, from whence he would haue
sent certeine lords with a power to haue distressed the Kentishmen, but the men said
to their lords they would not fight against them that laboured to amend the common-weale:
wherefore the lords were driuen to leaue their purpose. And bicause the
Kentishmen cried out against the lord Saie the kings chamberline, he was by the
king committed to the Tower of London. Then went the king againe to London,
&amp; within two dais after went against the Kentishmen with fift&eacute;ene thousand men well
prepared for the war: but the said Kentishmen fled the night before his comming into
the wood countrie n&eacute;ere vnto Senocke. Wherevpon the king returned againe to London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Staffords slaine at Senocke by Iacke Cade.</div>

<p>The qu&eacute;ene (that bare rule) being of his retrait aduertised, sent sir Humfreie Stafford
knight, and William his brother, with manie other gentlemen, to follow the
Kentishmen, thinking that they had fled: but they were deceiued, for at the first
skirmish both the Staffords were slaine, &amp; all their companie discomfited. The kings
armie by this time comen to Blackheath, hearing of this discomfiture, began to
murmur amongst themselues: some wishing the duke of Yorke at home to aid the
capteine his cousine: some vndutifullie coueting the ouerthrow of the king and his
councell: other openlie crieng out on the qu&eacute;ene and hir complices.</p>

<p>This rumor published abroad, caused the king and certeine of his councell (for the
appeasing thereof) to commit the lord Saie treasurer of England to the Tower of London;
and if other (against whome like displeasure was borne) had b&eacute;ene present, they had
b&eacute;ene likewise committed. Iacke Cade vpon victorie against the Staffords apparelled
himselfe in sir Humfries brigandine set full of guilt nailes, and so in some glorie
returned againe toward London; diuerse idle and vagarant persons out of Sussex,
Surreie and other places, still increasing his number. Thus this glorious capteine,
garded with a multitude of rusticall people, came againe to the plaine of Blackheath,
&amp; there stronglie incamped himselfe: to whome were sent from the king, the archbishop
of Canturburie, and Humfrie duke of Buckingham, to common with him of his gr&eacute;efes
and requests.</p>

<p>These lords found him sober in talke, wise in reasoning, arrogant in hart, and
stiffe in opinion; as who that by no means would grant to dissolue his armie, except
the king in person would come to him, and assent to the things he would require.
The K. vpon the presumptuous answers &amp; requests of this villanous rebell, begining
asmuch to doubt his owne meniall seruants, as his vnknowen subiects (which spared
not to speake, that the capteins cause was profitable for the common-wealth) departed
in all hast to the castell of Killingworth in Warwikeshire, leauing onlie behind him
the lord Scales to k&eacute;epe the Tower of London. The Kentish capteine being aduertised
of the kings absence, came first into Southwarke, and there lodged at the white hart,
prohibiting to all his retinue, murder, rape, and robberie; by which colour of well
meaning, he the more allured to him the harts of the common people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The lord Saie beheaded at the sta&#x0304;dard in Cheap.</div>

<p>After that, he entered into London, cut the ropes of the draw bridge, &amp; strooke
his sword on London stone; saieng, Now is Mortimer lord of this citie. And after
a glosing declaration made to the maior touching the cause of his thither comming
he departed againe into Southwarke, and vpon the third daie of Iulie he caused sir
Iames Fines, lord Saie, and treasuror of England, to be brought to the Guildhall,
and there to be arreigned: who being before the kings iustices put to answer,
desired to be tried by his p&eacute;eres, for the longer delaie of his life. The capteine perceiuing
his dilatorie pl&eacute;e, by force tooke him from the officers, and brought him to
the standard in Cheape, and there (before his confession ended) caused his head to be
striken off, and pitched it vpon an high pole, which was openlie borne before him
thorough the str&eacute;ets.</p>

<p>And not content herewith, he went to Mile end, and there apprehended sir Iames
Cromer then shiriffe of Kent, and sonne in law to the said lord Saie, causing him
likewise (without confession or excuse heard) to be beheaded, and his head to be fixed
on a pole: and with these two heads this bloudie wretch entred into the citie againe,
and as it were in a spite caused them in euerie str&eacute;et to kisse togither, to the great
detestation of all the beholders. After this succ&eacute;eded open rapine, and manifest
robberie in diuerse houses within the citie, and speciallie in the house of Philip Malpas
alderman of London, and diuerse other; ouer and beside ransoming and fining of
diuers notable merchants, for the suertie of their liues and goods; as Robert Horne
alderman, which paid fiue hundred marks. He also put to execution in Southwarke
diuerse persons, some for breaking his ordinance, and other being of his old acquaintance,
lest they should bewraie his base linage, disparaging him for his vsurped surname
of Mortimer.</p>

<p>The maior and other the magistrates of London, perceiuing themselues neither to be
sure of goods, nor of life well warranted, determined to repell and k&eacute;epe out of their
citie such a mischieuous caitife and his wicked companie. And to be the better able so
to doo, they made the lord Scales, and that renowmed capteine Matthew <a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>Gough
priuie both of their intent and enterprise, bes&eacute;eching them of their helpe and furtherance
therein. The lord Scales promised them his aid, with shooting off the artillerie
in the Tower; and Matthew Gough was by him appointed to assist the maior and
Londoners in all that he might, and so he and other capteins, appointed for defense
of the citie, tooke vpon them in the night to k&eacute;epe the bridge, and would not suffer
the Kentishmen once to approch. The rebels, who neuer soundlie slept for feare of
sudden assaults, hearing that the bridge was thus kept, ran with great hast to open
that passage, where betw&eacute;ene both parties was a fierce and cruell fight.</p>

than he thought they would haue doone, aduised his companie not to aduance anie
further toward Southwarke, till the daie appeared; that they might s&eacute;e where the
place of ieopardie rested, and so to prouide for the same: but this little auailed. For
the rebels with their multitude draue backe the citizens from the stoops at the bridge
foot to the draw bridge, &amp; began to set fire in diuerse houses. Great ruth it was to
behold the miserable state, wherein some desiring to eschew the fire died vpon their
enimies weapon; women with children in their armes lept for feare into the riuer,
other in a deadlie care how to saue themselues, betw&eacute;ene fire, water, and sword, were
in their houses choked and smothered. Yet the capteins not sparing, fought on the
bridge all the night valiantlie: but in conclusion, the rebels gat the draw bridge, and

<p>This sore conflict indured in doubtfull wise on the bridge, till nine of the clocke in

and suddenlie againe, the rebels were repelled to the stoops in Southwarke, so that
both parts being faint and wearie, agr&eacute;ed to leaue off from fighting till the next daie;
vpon condition, that neither Londoners should passe into Southwarke, nor Kentishmen
into London. Vpon this abstinence, this rakehell capteine for making him more

people, by their late repulse, to be somewhat asswaged, passed by the riuer of Thames
from the Tower into Southwarke, bringing with them vnder the kings great seale,
a generall pardon vnto all the offenders, and caused the same to be openlie published.
The poore people were so glad of this pardon, and so readie to receiue it, that without
bidding farewell to their capteine, they withdrew themselues the same night euerie

put all his pillage and goods that he had robbed, into a barge, and sent it to
Rochester by water, and himselfe went by land, and would haue entred into the castle
of Quinborow with a few men that were left about him; but he was there let of his

Thomas Dagre, slue there a woman with child, and for that cause tooke the gr&eacute;eth of

liegemen, as it is now openlie knowne, to bring himselfe to great and high estate) falslie and

<div class="sidenote">Capteine of Kent taken &amp; beheaded.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl. ex I. St.</i> 663, 664.</div>

<p>After which proclamation thus published, a gentleman of Kent named Alexander
Eden awaited so his time, that he tooke the said Cade in a garden in Sussex: so that
there he was slaine at Hothfield, and brought to London in a cart, where he was
quartered; his head set on London bridge, and his quarters sent to diuerse places to
be set vp in the shire of Kent. After this, the king himselfe came into Kent, and
there set in iudgment vpon the offendors: and if he had not mingled his iustice with
mercie, more than fiue hundred by rigor of law had b&eacute;ene iustlie put to execution.
Yet he punishing onelie the stubborne heads, &amp; disordered ringleaders, pardoned the
ignorant and simple persons, to the great reioising of all his subiects. &para; But saith
another, the king sent his commissioners into Kent, and caused inquirie to be made of
this riot in Canturburie, where for the same eight men were iudged and executed, and
in other townes of Kent and Sussex was doone the like execution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop of Salisburie murthered.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A fray in Lo&#x0304;don against the maior.</div>

<p>This yeare the commons also in diuerse parts of England, as in Sussex, Salisburie,
Wiltshire, and other places, did much harme to manie persons, among the which, on
the nine and twentith of Iune, William Ascoth bishop of Salisburie (after he had said
masse at Edington) was by his owne tenants drawne from the altar, in his albe with his
stole about his necke to the top of an hill, and there by them shamefullie murthered,
and after spoiled to the naked skin: they renting his bloudie shirt, tooke euerie man a
p&eacute;ece, and made boast of their wickednesse. The daie before, his chariot was robbed,
to the value of ten thousand markes. Soldiours made a fraie against the maior of
London the same daie he tooke his charge at Westminster, at night comming from
saint Thomas of Acres, after he had b&eacute;ene at Paules.</p>

<p>The French king vnderstanding all the ciuill discord and rebellious sturs in England,
made therof his foundation, hoping to get into his hands and possession the
duchie of Aquitaine: and therevpon sent the earles of Pontheieuure and Perigort to
laie siege to the towne of Bergerat, situate vpon the riuer of Dourdon, of which
towne was capteine Iohn Gedding, who vpon reasonable conditions rendred the
towne. But yet the lord Camois, sir George Seimor, and sir Iohn Arundell, with
diuers other valiant capteins hauing gouernance of the countrie, manned townes,
gathered people, and recomforted the fainting harts of the Gascoignes in all that they
could, and withall sent letters ouer into England, certifieng to the kings maiestie,
that without sp&eacute;edie aid and readie succours, the whole countrie was like to be conquered
and woone out of the Englishmens possession.</p>

<p>Manie letters were sent, and manie faire answers were brought; but rel&eacute;efe neither
appeared, nor one man of warre was thither shipped: by reason whereof the Frenchmen
pursuing the victorie, got the fortresses of Iansacke, and S. Foie, with diuerse
other p&eacute;eces of importance thereabouts. Also, about the same time, the lord Doruall,
third sonne to the lord de la Breth, with a great number of men, as well on horssebacke
as on foot, departed from Basas, to conquer and destroie the Ile of Medoc. Wherevpon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the maior of Burdeaux issuing out, and incountring with his enimies, was vanquished,
losing six hundred Englishmen and Gascoignes: albeit the Frenchmen gained not this
victorie with cl&eacute;ere hands, for there were slaine of them to the number of eight
hundred persons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1451</div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Arminack an open enimie.</div>

<p>After this, the bastard of Orleance, with his brother Iohn earle of Angolesme,
which had b&eacute;ene long prisoner in England, and manie other valiant capteins, besieged
the castell of Montguion, which to them was rendered. Afterwards, they besieged
the towne of Blaie, standing on the riuer of Garonne, the which in conclusion by
verie force was conquered and woone. The bastard of Kendall, capteine of the
castell, s&eacute;eing the towne lost, vpon certeine reasonable conditions deliuered his fortresse
to the bastard of Orleance, the French kings lieutenant. After this, the townes of
Burgh and Liborne, after fiue w&eacute;ekes siege, were likewise y&eacute;elded to the Frenchmen.
Then was the citie of Acques besieged by the erle of Fois, and the vicount de Lawtrec
his brother, and other noble men. So likewise was the strong towne of Rion by
the earle of Arminacke, extreame enimie to the realme of England, for breach of the
mariage concluded betw&eacute;ene king Henrie and his daughter. The earle of Ponthieuure
laid siege to Chatillon in Perigort, and the earle of Dunois inuironned with great
puissance the towne of Fronsacke.</p>

<p>The Englishmen perceiuing in what state they stood within the towne, couenanted
with the said earle, that if the towne were not succoured, and the Frenchmen fought
with before the feast of the natiuitie of saint Iohn Baptist next insuing; that then
the towne of Fronsacke should be y&eacute;elded to them, which was the strongest fortresse
in all that countrie, and the verie keie of Guien. H&eacute;ereof were pledges deliuered,
and writings made &amp; sealed. Which agr&eacute;ement once blowne through the countrie,
the citie of Burdeaux, and all other townes (except Baion) made the like agr&eacute;ement.
So did all the noble men and gentlemen which were subiects and vassels to the crowne
of England. Euerie daie was looking for aid, but none came.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Through dissention at home, all lost abroad.</div>

<p>And whie? Euen bicause the diuelish diuision that reigned in England, so incombred
the heads of the noble men there, that the honor of the realme was cl&eacute;erelie
forgotten, so that (to conclude) the daie appointed came, but succour looked for
came not. By reason whereof, all the townes of Aquitaine (except Baion) deliuered
their keies, and became vassals to the French nation; yet the citizens of Burdeaux,
in hope of rescue, required a longer daie of battell, which was granted. But at the
daie appointed, when no rel&eacute;efe came, they rendred themselues and the citie to their
aduersaries, their liues and goods saued, with licence and safe conduct to all persons
which would depart and saile into England. Then finallie was the citie of Baion besieged,
and with mines and batterie constreined to y&eacute;eld it selfe into the Frenchmens hands.</p>

<p>Beside the agr&eacute;ements taken and made with the townes, diuerse noble men made
seuerall compositions, as Gaston de Fois, &amp; Capdaw de Buef, whome king Henrie the
fift made earle of Longeuile, and knight of the garter; whose ancestors were euer
true to England. Which agr&eacute;ed, that he and his sonne Iohn de Fois, whome king
Henrie the sixt made earle of Kendale, and also knight of the garter, should enioy
all their lands in Aquitaine, giuen to them by the kings of England, or by the dukes
of Aquitaine. And sith their intent was still to serue the king of England, they
agr&eacute;ed to deliuer into the custodie of the earle of Fois, the sonne and heire of the
said earle of Kendale, being of the age of thr&eacute;e yeares; to the intent that if he at
his full age denied to become subiect to the French king, or before that time deceassed;
that then (after the death of his father and grandfather) all the said lands should
wholie remaine to the next heire of their bloud, either male or female, being vnder
the obeisance of the French king or his heires.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl. ex Anglorum pr&aelig;tijs sub Henr.</i> 6.</div>

<p>Manie other noble men, whose hearts were good English, made like compositions,
and some came into England, and others went to Calis, and bare great offices there:
as the lord Duras, which was marshall of that towne; and monsieur Vauclere, which
was deputie there vnder the earle of Warwike. Thus were the Englishmen cl&eacute;erelie
displaced and lost the possession of all the countries, townes, castels, and places
within the realme of France; so that onelie Calis, Hammes and Guines, with the
marches thereof remained in their hands, of all those their dominions and seigniories
which they sometime held in the parties beyond the seas. Whereby England suffered
a partile but not a totall eclipse of hir glorie, in continuall loosing &amp; nothing gaining of
the enimie. &para; Which recouerie was of great facilitie to the French, for that where
they came, they found litle or no resistance, but rather a voluntarie submission &amp;
y&eacute;elding as it were with holding vp of hands, yer they came to hanidstroks. So that

<div class="sidenote">The king receiued into Excester.</div>

<p>[This yeare the king made a generall progresse and came to the citie of Excester,
on mondaie the sixt&eacute;enth of Iulie at after noone, being the feast daie of saint
Kenelme; and was receiued from place to place verie honorablie through the
whole countrie. Before he came to this citie, he was met by all the cleargie in their
degr&eacute;es, some thr&eacute;e miles, some two miles, and some at the citie, all in their copes,
censing all the waies as they went. As soone as he came to this citie, he was first
conducted to the cathedral church in all most honourable order. When he had
doone his oblations, he was conueied and lodged in the bishops house. During his
abode here, there was a sessions kept before the duke of Summerset, and certeine
men condemned to die for treason, and had iudgement to be executed to death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop &amp; his cleargie against the K. and the duke of Summerset, &amp;c. in defense of their ecclesiasticall priuilege.</div>

<p>The bishop and his clergie vnderstanding hereof, with open mouth complained
vnto the king, that he caused a sessions to be kept within his sanctuarie, contrarie
to the priuilege of his church: and that all their dooings (being doone against law)
were of no effect. And notwithstanding the king and his councell had discoursed
vnto them the iust and orderlie proc&eacute;eding, the heinousnesse of the offendors, and
the necessitie of their punishment: yet all could not auaile, for holie church nor the
sanctuarie might be prophaned (as they said) with the deciding of temporall matters.
Wherevpon the king in the end y&eacute;elding to their exclaimes, released a couple of
arrant traitors, and reuersed all his former lawfull proc&eacute;edings, and so vpon the wednesdaie
he departed and returned towards London.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorke maketh claime to the crowne.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Iohn Stow.</div>

<p>The duke of Yorke pretending (as y&eacute;e haue heard) a right to the crowne, as heire
to Lionell duke of Clarence, came this yeare out of Ireland vnto London, in the parlement
time, there to consult with his speciall fr&eacute;ends: as Iohn duke of Northfolke,
Richard earle of Salisburie, and the lord Richard his sonne, which after was earle of
Warwike; Thomas Courtneie earle of Deuonshire, and Edward Brooke lord Cobham.
After long deliberation and aduise taken, it was thought expedient, to k&eacute;epe their
ch&eacute;efe purpose secret; and that the duke should raise an armie of men, vnder a pretext
to remooue diuerse councellors about the king, and to reuenge the manifest iniuries
doone to the common-wealth by the same rulers. Of the which as principall,
the duke of Summerset was namelie accused, both for that he was greatlie hated of
the commons for the losse of Normandie: and for that it was well knowne, that he
would be altogither against the duke of Yorke in his chalenge to be made (when time
serued) to the crowne; insomuch that his goods by the commons were foulie despoiled
and borne awaie from the Blacke friers. After which riot, on the next morrow pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>clamation
was made through the citie, that no man should spoile or rob, on paine of
death. But on the same daie at the standard in Cheape was a man beheaded for dooing
contrarie to the proclamation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorke raiseth a power, for recouerie of his right to the crowne.</div>

<p>Therefore when the duke of Yorke had thus, by aduise of his speciall fr&eacute;ends,
framed the foundation of his long intended enterprise, he assembled a great hoast, to
the number of ten thousand able men, in the marches of Wales; publishing openlie,
that the cause of this his gathering of people, was for the publike wealth of the
realme. The king much astonied at the matter, by aduise of his councell raised
a great power, and marched forward toward the duke. But he being thereof aduertised,
turned out of that way, which by espials he vnderstood that the king held,
and made streight toward London: and hauing knowledge that he might not be suffered
to passe through the citie, he crossed ouer the Thames at Kingston bridge, and
so kept on towards Kent, where he knew that he had both fr&eacute;ends &amp; well-willers, and
there on Burnt heath, a mile from Dertford, and twelue miles from London, he imbatelled,
and incamped himselfe verie stronglie, inuironing his field with artillerie and
trenches. The king hereof aduertised, brought his armie with all diligence vnto
Blackeheath, and there pight his tents.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The dukes answer to the kings message.</div>

<p>Whilest both these armies laie thus imbattelled, the king sent the bishop of Winchester,
and Thomas Bourchier, bishop of Elie, Richard Wooduile, lord Riuers, &amp;
Richard Andrew, the k&eacute;eper of his priuie seale, to the duke: both to know the cause
of so great a commotion, and also to make a concord; if the requests of the duke and
his companie s&eacute;emed consonant to reason. The duke hearing the message of the
bishops, answered; that his comming was neither to damnifie the king in honour, nor
in person, neither yet anie good man: but his intent was, to remooue from him certeine
euill disposed persons of his councell, bloud-succours of the nobilitie, pollers of
the cleargie, and oppressours of the poore people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl. ex I. S. pag. 666, 667, in Quart.</i></div>

<p>Amongst these, he ch&eacute;eflie named Edmund duke of Summerset, whome if the king
would commit to ward, to answer such articles as against him in open parlement should
be both proponed and proued, he promised not onelie to dissolue his armie; but also
offered himselfe (like an obedient subiect) to come to the kings presence, and to doo
him true and faithfull seruice, according to his loiall and bounden dutie. &para; But a further

and pacifieng of the duke and his people, that the duke of Summerset was committed
to ward, as some say; or else commanded to k&eacute;epe himselfe priuie in his owne house
for a time. But it should s&eacute;eme by that which some haue written, that the duke of
Yorke was deceiued of the hope which he had, to be aided of the Kentishmen;
insomuch that when he saw himselfe ouermatched by the king in number of people,
who had got togither thrice as manie men as the duke had there with him, the duke
was the more easie to be dealt with. And so comming to the king, and submitting
himselfe by mediation of certeine of the nobilitie, he obteined pardon of that his
former presumptuous enterprise. And within a few daies after his comming to London
with the king, he openlie in the church of S. Paule (the king being present) receiued
a solemne oth, that from thenceforth, he should no more commit any such offence,
nor attempt anie thing, either against the king, or any other of his liege people,
contrarie to the order of law and iustice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorke accuseth the duke of Su&#x0304;merset.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A mutuall charge betw&eacute;ene the two dukes, Yorke and Summerset of his treason.</div>

<p>Howsoeuer the matter went, truth it is, that the duke of Yorke, the first of March,
dissolued his armie, brake vp his campe, &amp; came to the king's tent, where contrarie
to his expectation, &amp; against promise made by the king (as other write) he found the
duke of Summerset going at large and set at libertie, whome the duke of Yorke
boldlie accused of treason, briberie, oppression, and manie other crimes. The duke
of Summerset not onelie made answer to the dukes obiections, but also accused him
of high treason, affirming, that he with his fautors and complices had consulted
togither, how to come by the scepter and regall crowne of this realme. By meanes
of which words the king remooued streight to London, and the duke of Yorke
(as prisoner) rode before him, and so was kept a while.</p>

<p>The king assembled togither a great councell at Westminster to heare the accusations
of the two dukes, the one obiecting to the other manie heinous and gr&eacute;euous crimes.
But the duke of Summerset, which now conceiued in his mind the thing that
shortlie followed, incessantlie exhorted the councell, that the duke of Yorke, by
compulsion or otherwise, might be driuen to confesse his offence, that so being attainted
of treason, he might suffer execution, and his children to be taken as aduersaries
to their natiue countrie; to the intent that by the extinction of him and his sequeale,
all ciuill warre and inward diuision might ceasse and be repressed: bes&eacute;eching
almightie God, that so great an enimie to the king and his bloud, might neuer escape
punishment, nor continue long in life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Destinie cannot be auoided.</div>

<p>The duke of Summerset set foorth this matter the more vehementlie, bicause he knew
perfectlie, that the duke of Yorke dailie imagined with himselfe, how to get the
crowne, and to depose and destroie both the king and him. But destinie cannot by
anie mans deuise be letted, and manie things (to appearance) declared the duke of
Yorkes innocencie in this case. First, his fr&eacute;e and voluntarie comming to the king,
without constreint, when he was partlie of puissance able to haue incountred with
the kings whole power. Secondlie, his humble submission, and reasonable requests,
as well on his owne behalfe, as for the poore commons: which might argue that he
sought for no souereigntie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occasion that set the duke of Yorke fr&eacute;e.</div>

<p>Whilest the councell treated of sauing or dispatching of this duke of Yorke, a
rumor sprang through London, that Edward earle of March, sonne and heire
apparent to the saide duke, with a great armie of Marchmen, was comming toward
London: which tidings sore appalled the qu&eacute;ene and the whole councell. Beside
this, the verie same daie came ambassadours from the ch&eacute;efe citizens and magistrats
of the citie of Burdeaux: whereof the ch&eacute;efe were, the earle of Kendale, and the
lord de Lesparre; which signified to the councell, that if they would send an armie
into Gascoigne, the people of the countrie would reuolt from the French part, and
eftsoones become English. These two things sore troubled the heads of the councell,
which, least inward sedition might hinder outward conquests, set the duke of Yorke
at libertie, and permitted him to go to his castell of Wigmore, in the marches of
Wales, by whose absence the duke of Summerset rose in such high fauour, both with
the king and qu&eacute;ene, that his word onelie ruled, and his voice alone was heard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Reg. 31.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1453.</div>

<p>The councell not forgetting the offer of the Gascoignes, and that they might now
haue the citie of Burdeaux, with the countrie round about, by request of the inhabitants,
appointed the valiant capteine Iohn lord Talbot earle of Shrewesburie, to go
thither with an armie: who arriuing in the Isle of Madre, passed foorth with his power,
being scant thr&eacute;e thousand men, and tooke the strong towne of Fronsacke, and
diuerse other townes &amp; fortresses. The inhabitants of Burdeaux, hearing of the
earles arriual, sent to him messengers in the darke night, requiring him with all sp&eacute;ed
to come and receiue the citie. The earle lost not one houre, but hasted foorth, &amp;
came before that citie, yer the Frenchmen within vnderstood anie thing of the citizens
purpose. When they were aduertised that there was a gate set open for the Englishmen
to enter, they thought to haue escaped secretlie by a posterne: but they were pursued,
slaine, and taken by the lord de Lespar, and other of the English armie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French people soone wearie of the French gouernment.</div>

<p>After the regaining of Burdeaux, there arriued at Blaie the bastard of Summerset,
sir Iohn Talbot, lord Lisle by his wife, sonne to the said erle of Shrewesburie, the
lord Molins, the lord Harington, the lord Camois, sir Iohn Howard, sir Iohn Montgomerie,
sir Iohn Vernon, with two and twentie hundred men, with vittels and
munitions. When the earle was thus (according to his intent) of all things furnished,
first he fortified Burdeaux with Englishmen, and store of vittels; and after that he
rode into the countrie abroad, where he obteined cities, and got townes without
stroke or dint of sword, for the people alreadie wearied of the French seruitude, and
longing sore to return to the English libertie, s&eacute;emed to desire nothing more than to
haue the earle to receiue them into the English obeisance. Amongst other townes,
the towne and castell of Chastillon in Perigort was to him deliuered, the which he
fortified with men and ordinance verie stronglie.</p>

<p>In the meane time, the French king, being aduertised of all these dooings, raised
an armie to resist this inuasion made by the erle of Shrewesburie. And first he
appointed his capteins to besiege the towne of Chastillon, to the rescue whereof the
earle hasted forward, hauing in his companie eight hundred horssemen, vnder the
leading of his sonne the lord Lisle, the lord Molins, the lord Camois, sir Edward Hull,
sir Iohn Howard, and sir Iohn Vernon. He appointed also fiue thousand footmen, vnder
the conduct of the earle of Kendall, and the lord de Lespar, to follow him with all
sp&eacute;ed. In his waie, he tooke by fine force a tower which the Frenchmen had taken,
and slue all that he found within it. And after by the waie, he met fiue hundred
Frenchmen going a foraging, of whome he slue the more part, and chased the other
to the campe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The valiant earle of Shrewesburie and his son manfullie slaine.</div>

<p>The Frenchmen that laie at the siege, perceiuing by those good runners away that
the earle approched, left the siege, and retired in good order into the place which
they had trenched, diched, and fortified with ordinance. The earle aduertised how
the siege was remoued, hasted forward towards his enimies, doubting most, least they
would haue b&eacute;ene quite fled and gone before his comming. But they fearing the
displeasure of the French king (who was not far off) if they should haue fled, abode
the earles comming, and so receiued him: who though he first with manfull courage,
and sore fighting wan the entrie of their campe; yet at length they compassed him
about, and shooting him through the thigh with an handgun, slue his horsse, and
finally killed him lieng on the ground, whome they durst neuer looke in the face,
while he stood on his f&eacute;et.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>It was said, that after he perceiued there was no remedie, but present losse of the
battell, he counselled his sonne the lord Lisle, to saue himselfe by flight, sith the same
could not redound to anie great reproch in him, this being the first iournie in which he
had b&eacute;ene present. Manie words he vsed to persuade him to haue saued his life: but
nature so wrought in the son, that neither desire of life, nor feare of death, could
either cause him to shrinke, or conueie himselfe out of the danger, and so there manfullie
ended his life with his said father. There died also the earles bastard sonne
Henrie Talbot, and sir Edward Hull elect to the order of the garter, and thirtie other
men of name and right valiant personages of the English nation. The lord Molins
was taken prisoner with thr&eacute;escore others. The residue of the English people fled to
Burdeaux and other places, of whome in the flight were slaine aboue a thousand
persons.</p>

<p>Thus at this battell of Chatillon, fought the thirt&eacute;enth daie of Iulie in this yeare,
ended his life Iohn lord Talbot, and of his progenie the first earle of Shrewesburie:
after that he with much fame and most victorie, had valiantlie made warre, and serued
his prince and countrie by the space of foure and twentie yeares, in the parties beyond
the seas, whose corps was left on ground, and after was found by his fr&eacute;ends,
and conueied to Whitchurch in Shropshire where it was interred. After this discomfiture
diuerse lords fled to Burdeaux, but the earle of Candall, the lords of Montferrant,
of Rosaine, &amp; of Dangladas entered into the castell of Chatillon, which by
the space of ten daies they defended: but in the end despairing of all succours, they
rendred the fortresse, and came safe to Burdeaux.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burdeaux yielded againe to the French.</div>

<p>After this, the townes of saint Million, Liborne, and all other, which the erle of
Shrewesburie had conquered, rendred themselues to the Frenchmen, Burdeaux onelie
excepted. Which citie, being the last refuge of the English people, the French
king in person besieged with all his puissance; and in conclusion constreined both the
garrisons and inhabitants to y&eacute;eld, so that the Englishmen &amp; Gascoignes might safelie
depart into England or into Calis, with all their substance; and that the lords de
Lesparre, Duras, and thirtie others, should neuer (vpon paine of death) be found
within anie of the French kings dominions, which lord de Lesparre being after taken
in Gascoigne disguised, was made shorter by the head. When this composition was
agr&eacute;ed and sealed, the Englishmen were shortlie transported ouer into England, in the
moneth of October this present yeare.</p>

<p>Thus was the duchie of Aquitaine, which had continued in the English possession,
from the yeare of our Lord 1155, vnto this present yeare, which is n&eacute;ere hand thr&eacute;e
hundred yeares, by the mariage of Elenor daughter and heire to William duke of
Aquitaine, wife to king Henrie the second, finallie reduced and brought againe to the
French obedience and seruitude. Within that onlie duchie be foure archbishops, foure
and twentie bishops, fift&eacute;ene earledomes, two hundred and two baronies, and aboue a
thousand capteinships and baliffewikes: whereby ye may consider, what a losse this
was to the realme of England. On the thirt&eacute;enth daie of October this yeare, was
the qu&eacute;ene deliuered at Westminster of a faire sonne, who was christened, and named
Edward.</p>

<p>His mother susteined not a little slander and obloquie of the common people, who
had an opinion that the king was not able to get a child; and therefore sticked not to
saie, that this was not his sonne, with manie slanderous words, greatlie sounding to
the qu&eacute;enes dishonour; much part perchance vntrulie. After the birth of this child,
he highlie aduanced his brethren on his mothers side; for Edmund he made earle of
Richmond, which was father to king Henrie the seuenth, and Iasper he created erle
of Penbroke, which died without issue. &para; This yeare, Iohn Stafford archbishop of
Canturburie departed this life, and Iohn Kempe archbishop of Yorke was remoued
from that s&eacute;e, to succ&eacute;ed in place of the said Stafford, being the thr&eacute;e score and se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>cond

the shiriffe was faine to craue helpe of the maior, who with his brethren the aldermen
arose from the game, and strengthened the shiriffes. And for the rescue of the
said gentleman, one named Calis, came out of saint Iohns with a great strength of
archers, to resist the maior, in the which fraie a yeoman of saint Iohns was slaine,
and manie other sore hurt. The maior himselfe escaped hardlie, for his cap was smitten
from his head with an arrow: but the maior with his citizens put the other to flight,
sent the principall of them to Newgate, and then tooke his place againe till the games

<p>After the warres foulie ended in forren parties, ciuill dissention began againe at home,
diuided speciallie into two factions. As K. Henrie descended of the house of Lancaster
possessed the crowne from his grandfather king Henrie the fourth (first author of
that title) so Richard duke of Yorke, as heire to Lionell duke of Clarence, third sonne
to king Edward the third, inforced. By reason whereof, the nobles as well as the common
people were into parts diuided, to the vtter destruction of manie a man, and to
the great ruine and decaie of this region: for while the one partie sought to destroie
the other, all care of the common-wealth was set aside, and iustice and equitie clearelie
exiled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorke s&eacute;eks the destrucio&#x0304; of the duke of Sommerset.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He banded himselfe with the Neuils.</div>

<p>The duke of Yorke (aboue all things) first sought means how to stir vp the malice
of the people against the duke of Summerset, imagining that he being made awaie,
his purpose should the sooner take effect. He also practised to bring the king into
the hatred of the people, as that he should not be a man apt to the gouernment of a
realme, wanting both wit and stomach sufficient to supplie such a roome. Manie of
the high estates, not liking the world, and disalowing the dooings both of the
king and his councell, were faine inough of some alteration. Which thing the duke
well vnderstanding, chiefelie sought the fauour of the two Neuils, both named Richard,
one earle of Salisburie, the other earle of Warwike, the first being the father,
and the second the sonne.</p>

at the siege of Orleance (as before is declared) of which woman he begat Richard,
Iohn, and George: Richard the eldest sonne espoused Anne, the sister and heire of
the entire bloud of lord Henrie Beauchamp earle and after duke of Warwike, in
whose right and title he was created and named earle of Warwike. [Full fraught
was this nobleman with good qualities right excellent and manie, all which a certeine

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<p>When the duke of Yorke had fastened his chaine betw&eacute;ene these two strong pillers,
he with his fr&eacute;ends wrought so effectuouslie, and handled his businesse so politikelie,
that the duke of Summerset was arested in the qu&eacute;enes great chamber, and sent to the
Tower of London, where he kept his Christmasse without great solemnitie. Against
whom, soone after in open parlement were laid diuerse and heinous articles of high
treason, as well for the losse of Normandie, as for the late mischance which happened
in Guien. The king at that time was sicke at Clarendon, and conueied to London,
by reason whereof no finall determination proc&eacute;eded in this weightie cause; but all
was put in suspense, till the next assemblie of the high court of parlement. Some doo
write, that whilest the king was sicke, the duke of Yorke bare all the rule, and gouerned
as regent or viceroie, by authoritie committed to him by the lords of the realme,
then assembled in councell; he to s&eacute;e to the preseruation and good gouernement of
the common-wealth, during the kings sicknesse, which was so gr&eacute;euous (as it was

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Summerset set at libertie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Made deputie of Calis.</div>

<p>The duke of Yorke hauing aforehand obteined an absolution of the pope, in discharge
of his oth before taken, did now discouer his stomach against the duke of Summerset.
But when the king was amended againe, and resumed to him his former gouernement,
either of his owne mind, or by the qu&eacute;enes procurement, the duke of Summerset
was set at libertie; by which doing, great enuie and displeasure grew. That notwithstanding,
the qu&eacute;ene (which then bare the chiefe rule) caused the duke of Summerset
to be preferred to the capteineship of Calis, wherwith not onlie the commons,
but also manie of the nobilitie were greatlie gr&eacute;eued and offended, saieng, that he had
lost Normandie, and so would he doo Calis.</p>

<p>The duke of Yorke and his adherents, perceiuing that neither exhortation nor charging
him with his crimes preuailed against the duke of Summerset, they meant to
mend the matter by open war: &amp; soone after he being in the marches of Wales, accompanied
with his speciall friends, the earles of Salisburie, and Warwike, the lord
Cobham, and others, assembled a power, and in warlike maner marched toward London.
The king informed hereof, assembled likewise a great host, and meaning to
m&eacute;et with the duke, rather in the north parts than about London, where it was
thought he had too manie friends, he accompanied with the dukes of Summerset and
Buckingham, the earles of Penbroke, Stafford, Northumberland, Deuonshire, Dorset,
and Wilshire, the lords Clifford, Sudlie, Berneis, Roos, and others, being in all
aboue two thousand men of warre, departed from Westminster the twentith, or (as some

not be so hardie to make resistance against me in my owne realme. For I shall

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<p>But another historie-writer saith, that the king, when first he heard of the duke
of Yorks approch, sent to him messengers, the duke of Buckingham, and others to
vnderstand what he meant by his comming thus in maner of warre. The duke of
Buckingham to his message was answered by the duke of Yorke and his complices,
that they were all of them the kings faithfull liege subiects, and intended no harme
to him at all: but the cause of our comming (saie they) is not in meaning anie hurt
to his person. But let that wicked and naughtie man the duke of Summerset be
deliuered vnto vs, who hath lost Normandie, and taken no regard to the preseruation
of Gascoigne; and furthermore, hath brought the realme vnto this miserable estate;
that where it was the floure of nations, and the princesse of prouinces [now is it
haled into desolation &amp; spoile, not so dreadfull by malice of forren enimie, that ind&eacute;ed
vtterlie (as y&eacute;e know) s&eacute;eketh our ruine, as by the intollerable outrages of him that
so long ago &amp; euen still appeares to haue sworne the confusion of our king and realme.]
If it therefore please the king to deliuer that bad man into our hands, we are readie
without trouble or breach of peace, to returne into our countrie. But if the king be

<div class="sidenote">The first battell of saint Albons.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Edw. Hall.</i></div>

<p>The king aduertised of this answer, more wilfull than tollerable, appointed him
rather to trie battell, than deliuer the duke of Summerset to his enimies. Whereof
they ascerteined made no longer staie, but streightwaie sounded the trumpet to battell:
or rather (as Hall saith) while king Henrie sent foorth his ambassadours to treat of
peace at the one end of the towne, the earle of Warwike with his Marchmen entred
at the other end, and fiercelie setting on the kings fore-ward, within a small time discomfited
the same. The place where they first brake into the towne, was about the
middle of saint Peters str&eacute;et. The fight for a time was right sharpe and cruell, for
the duke of Summerset, with the other lords, comming to the succours of their companions
that were put to the woorse, did what they could to beat backe the enimies:
but the duke of Yorke sent euer fresh men to succour the wearie, and to supplie the
places of them that were hurt, whereby the kings armie was finallie brought low, and
all the ch&eacute;efteins of the field slaine and beaten downe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Summerset slaine.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas lord Clifford, saith <i>Whethamsted</i>.</div>

<p>For there died vnder the signe of the castell, Edmund duke of Summerset, who (as
hath b&eacute;ene reported) was warned long before to auoid all castels: and beside him laie
Henrie the second of that name earle of Northumberland, Humfrie earle of Stafford
sonne to the duke of Buckingham, Iohn lord Clifford, sir Barthram Antwisell knight,
a Norman borne (who forsaking his natiue countrie to continue in his loiall obedience to
king Henrie, came ouer to dwell here in England when Normandie was lost) William
Zouch, Iohn Boutreux, Rafe Bapthorp, with his sonne William Corwin, William Cotton,
Gilbert Faldinger, Reginald Griffon, Iohn Dawes, Elice Wood, Iohn Eith, Rafe Woodward,
Gilbert Sharlock, and Rafe Willoughbie esquiers, with manie other, in all to the
number of eight thousand, as Edward Hall saith in his chronicle: if there escaped not a
fault in the impression, as 8000 for 800, sith hundreds in verie d&eacute;ed would better agr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>&eacute;e
with the number of the kings whole power, which he brought with him to that battell,
being not manie aboue two thousand, as by writers appeareth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings part vanquished.</div>

<p>Humfrie duke of Buckingham, being wounded, and Iames Butler earle of Ormond
and Wilshire, and Thomas Thorp lord ch&eacute;efe baron of the escheker, s&eacute;eing fortune
thus against them, left the king alone, and with a number fled awaie. Those that
thus fled, made the best shift they could to get awaie through gardens and backesides,
through shrubs, hedges and woods, s&eacute;eking places where to hide themselues, vntill
that dangerous tempest of the battell were ouerblowne. Diuerse of the kings house
also that could better skill to plaie the courtiers than warriors, fled with the first; and
those of the east parts of the realme were likewise noted of too much lacke of courage,
for their sp&eacute;edie withdrawing themselues, and leauing the king in danger of his aduersaries:
who perceiuing his men thus fled from him, withdrew into a poore mans
house to saue himselfe from the shot of arrowes, that flue about him as thicke as
snow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl. ex I. S. pag. 678, 679, in Quart.</i></div>

<p>&para; This doone, saith one historien, the duke of Yorke, the earles of Warwike, and
Salisburie, came vnto the king where he was, and besought him on their kn&eacute;es of grace
and forgiuenesse for that they had doone in his presence, and besought him of his
highnesse to take them to grace, and as his true liege men. The king desiring them
to cease their people, that there should be no more hurt doone, and to obeie his commandement,
did cause to be proclamed in the kings name, that all manner of people
should cease off their malice, and not to smite one stroke more, and so ceassed the
battell. And vpon the day next after, the king and the duke of Yorke, the earles of
Warwike &amp; Salisburie, came all to London; and were lodged in the bishops palace of
London, where they kept their Whitsuntide with great ioy and solemnitie, concluding
there to hold a parlement, the same to begin on the ninth daie of Iulie next following.</p>

<p>Another historien saith, that the duke of Yorke, aduertised of the place into the
which the king was withdrawne for the safetie of himselfe, and taking him into his
power, comforted him in the best wise he could; assuring him, that now that the
common enimie of the realme was dispatched, to wit, the duke of Summerset, he had
cause rather to reioise, than to be sorie, sith his destruction was the kings preseruation.
And for himselfe and all his adherents he vndertooke, that they were and
would remaine, during life, his most faithfull liege people, readie in all points to serue
him, as his trustie and obedient subiects. After he had vsed such words, as wherewith
best to comfort him, he brought the king foorth of that simple house with all due
reuerence shewed toward him first to the shrine, and after to his chamber.</p>

<p>Whilest the duke of Yorke was about thus to comfort the king, the soldiers that
had the victorie now in their hands, applied the spoile, namelie, the Northerne men,
stripping not onelie those that had borne armor against them, but also the townsmen
and other, with whom they might m&eacute;et. So that it was thought, if the king had
taken vp his lodging at his first comming thither, within the abbeie, as he did not
(but in the middest of the towne, to prouide the better to resist his enimies) the abbeie
had b&eacute;ene spoiled also. This was the end of the first battell at saint Albons,
which was fought vpon the thursdaie next before the feast of Penthecost, being the
thr&eacute;e and twentith day of Maie, in this thr&eacute;e and thirtith yeare of the kings reigne.
The bodies of the noble men were buried in the monasterie in our ladies chappell, and
the meane people in other places. This Edmund duke of Summerset left behind him
thr&eacute;e sonnes, Henrie, Edmund and Iohn, which to the extremitie of death tooke part
with the line of king Henrie.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<p>[There was this yeare a great fight &amp; fraie vpon Clift heath, distant about two miles

preuailed &amp; had the victorie, who foorthwith came to this citie, and the gates
before being shut, were opened and he receiued; which thing so gr&eacute;eued the earle,
that he continuallie sought thencefoorth to be reuenged. But not long after in the
quarell betw&eacute;en king Henrie the sixt, and king Edward the fourth, he ended his
daies, and was beheaded at Yorke, and was the last of that line.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">A parlement.</div>

<p>The duke of Yorke, hauing gotten the victorie, remembred well, that he had
published abroad how the onelie cause of this warre was, for the aduancement of the
common-wealth, and therefore vsing all courtesie, would not touch the kings person
after anie violent sort; but with all honour and due reuerence conueied him to London
and so to Westminster. To which place was summoned a parlement, which began
the ninth daie of Iulie, in the which session, the late duke of Glocester was openlie
declared a true subiect, both to the king and to the realme. Beside this, it was
enacted, that no person should either iudge or report anie point of vntruth of the duke
of Yorke, the earles of Salisburie and Warwike, or of anie knight, esquier, archer, or
other, for comming in warlike araie against the king, at saint Albons; considering
their enterprise was onelie to s&eacute;e the kings person in safegard.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Collaterall.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A letter kept from the king of purpose.</div>

<p>But all the blame was put vpon the duke of Summerset, Thomas Thorp, baron of
the escheker, and William Iosep esquier, the kings collaterall companion; bicause that
they, vpon malicious purpose, kept a certeine letter from the kings knowledge, and
would in no wise suffer it to be deliuered vnto him, notwithstanding the same made
to the aduancement of some good peace, had it b&eacute;ene throughlie and aduisedlie read,
weied &amp; considered. In which letter they declared, that as faithfull and humble
subiects, they required onelie, that it would please the king (whose honor, health,
suertie, and preseruation, they ch&eacute;efelie wished) not to giue credence to their aduersaries
malicious suggestions, till their comming to his presence, vnto the which they
humblie besought him that they might be admitted as his faithfull liege people, to
shew the intent and purpose of their commings; which was to none other end, than to
declare their fidelitie and allegiance towards his most roiall person, intending to put
themselues with as much diligence and trauell in all things that might aduance his
honour, health, and safegard, as any subiect he had liuing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorkes comming against the king iustified.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorke made protector of the realme.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king to reigne in name but not in authoritie.</div>

<p>The k&eacute;eping backe of this letter from the kings sight and knowledge, did minister
matter sufficient vnto the parlement, to colour and iustifie for well doone all transgressions
committed in the late battell and chase at saint Albons. In this parlement also,
the duke of Yorke was made protector of the realme, and the earle of Salisburie was
appointed to be lord chancellour, and had the great seale to him deliuered, and the
earle of Warwike was elected to the office of the capteineship of Calis, and the
territories of the same; and thus the rule of the realme rested in the orders of the
duke and chancellour, and all warlike affaires remained, principallie in the earle of
Warwike. And so amongest them it was agr&eacute;ed, that king Henrie should reigne still
in name and dignitie, but neither in d&eacute;ed nor in authoritie; not minding to destroie
him, least they might suddenlie prouoke the furie of the common people against them,
bicause that of the simple sort of people he was for his holinesse of life, and abundant
clemencie, much fauoured and highlie est&eacute;emed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">An act for the K. to reuoke certeine grants.</div>

<p>In this parlement also it was enacted, that the king should resume, take into his
hands againe, haue and reteine into his possession, all honours, castels, lordships,
townes, villages, manours, lands, tenements, wasts, forests, chases, rents, reuersions,
f&eacute;es, farmes, seruices, issues, profits, counties, aduousons of priories, churches, hospitals,
and fr&eacute;e chapels, and all other reuenues with their appurtenances, the which
had passed from him since the first daie of his reigne vnto that present; either by his
letters patents, or authoritie of parlement, and manie other meanes, whether by grant,
confirmation, or release from him made in f&eacute;e simple, or f&eacute;e taile, for tearme of life
or yeares, to anie maner of person and persons in England, Wales, Scotland, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
marches; in Ireland, or in the townes of Calis, &amp; Guisnes, &amp; the marches there. And
likewise all grants made of such things as are aboue mentioned, being parcell of the
duchie of Lancaster; and further all grants of offices, roomes, f&eacute;es, wages, or commodities,
not accustomed to belong to anie office or charge before the said first daie of
the kings reigne, were likewise reuoked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shifting of officers.</div>

<p>Diuerse other things were also conteined within this reuocation and generall resumption;
with certeine exceptions yet and prouisoes had, as were thought conuenient, and
as by the same act it dooth appeare. Moreouer, now that the duke of Yorke and his
adherents had wrested the whole rule &amp; gouernement into their hands; all such persons
as the king either loued, or the qu&eacute;ene fauoured, were put beside the priuie councell;
and such put in their places, as were knowne to fauour the house of Yorke.
Also the officers were changed thoroughout the realme, at the will and disposition of
the protector, chancellour, and capteine of Calis; so that they constituted as it were
a triumuirat, ruling all things at discretion of these thr&eacute;e. And yet in all their rule
I find not that anie mention is made of their deferring of iustice, or of anie polling or
briberie: as was openlie prooued by such as gouerned before their time. Onelie they
were noted of diuerse spirituall persons, and namelie of the abbat of Westminster and
his moonks, for a great offense: bicause they tooke out of the sanctuarie at Westminster,
Iohn Holland duke of Excester, all against the order taken in the last parlement,
and sent him to the castell of Pomfret.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henrie duke of Summerset.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorke discharged of his office.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1456</div>

<p>But now the lord Henrie Beauford, newlie duke of Summerset by the death of duke
Edmund his father, slaine at the battell of saint Albons (as aboue is rehearsed) and
Humfrie duke of Buckingham (who then &amp; there lost his sonne and heire) and other
of estate taking the part of king Henrie, whose case they did much bewaile &amp; doubt,
as perceiuing whereto the courtesie of the duke of Yorke did draw: they therefore
thinking it necessarie to purueie for a remedie yer the misch&eacute;efe happened, consulted
with the qu&eacute;ene. By whose aduise was a great councell called at Gr&eacute;enewich, where
the duke of Yorke was discharged of his protectorship, &amp; the earle of Salisburie depriued
also of his office. &para; This sudden change amongst the nobilitie caused alterations,
and seditious attempts in the commonaltie, and in especiall within London: whereof
this was one. A yoong merchant, which before time had b&eacute;ene in diuerse cities of
Italie, and there forbidden by the magistrats (as the law and maner is) to weare anie
weapon, now challenged an Italian in Cheapside for wearing a dagger, telling him it
was against his owne countrie lawes: wherto bicause the Italian answered somewhat
disdainefullie, the merchant not onelie tooke by force from him his dagger, but also
with the same brake his pate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An vprore in the citie of London.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A foule disorder.</div>

<p>This Italian in great hast complained to the maior, so that at the next court holden
at the Guildhall, the merchant was sent for, and vpon charge of his offense, he was
commanded to ward. Wherevpon diuerse other light persons within the citie, assembled
togither in great plumps, by force constreined the maior to deliuer the prisoner out
of Newgate: and not so satisfied, like mad men ran to the seuerall houses of diuerse
Venetians, Lucases, and Florentins, and them spoiled, robbed, and rifled without reason
or measure. The maior, perceiuing this enormious dooing, assembled a number of
substantiall and graue citizens; who (not without bloudshed and maiming of sundrie)
appeased the rage, and caused the misruled people to depart to their houses. The
beginner of this vprore got him to Westminster, and there registred himselfe for a
sanctuarie man.</p>

<p>The qu&eacute;ene, which now againe ruled all, being aduertised of this vnlawfull misdemeanour,
sent the dukes of Excester and Buckingham, with other noble men to
London, with a commission oier and terminer, for the inquirie and punishment of so
seditious an offense. But when the maior, the two dukes, and the two ch&eacute;efe iustices
were set in the Guildhall vpon their commission, intelligence was giuen, that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
number of light persons were approching in armor to rescue the prisoners apprehended
for the late robberie and riot, as they were caried to their arraignement. The
two dukes and the other commissioners quickelie thense departed, and left their inquirie
for that daie, though in d&eacute;ed in no such danger as they doubted: for certeine
discr&eacute;et and sage citizens so handled the matter, that no misorder followed of that
furie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A common councell called.</div>

<p>The maior on the next daie called a common councell, whereof the number was an
hundred fourescore and od, who ordeined that all wardens of mysteries should assemble
their companies in their halles, where exhortation should be to the obseruation of peace;
and if they spied any man either readie to stirre a rumor, or make to the deliuerance of
such as were in prison, their names should be secretlie written, and so deliuered to
the maior: which policie well appeased this outrage. Wherevpon after the commissioners
sat in Guildhall, where manie of the robbers were attainted &amp; put to execution,
beside diuerse great fines set on the heads of diuerse merchants, &amp; paid, for
winking at the matter. &para; This yeare Iohn Kempe archbishop of Canturburie departed
this life, &amp; Thomas Burstlier bishop of Elie remooued to his place, being the thr&eacute;escore
and third archbishop of that s&eacute;e.</p>

crowed foure times, and euerie time turned him about, and beckened with his head,

standing vpon the riuage of the sea. The capteins of the one fl&eacute;et was William lord
Pomiers, and of the other sir Peter Bressie, a great ruler in Normandie. These two
capteins, taking their course out of the mouth of Saine, seuered themselues the one westward;
and the other eastward, which was sir Peter Bressie, who sailing alongst the coasts
of Sussex and Kent, durst not yet take land, but staid in the Downes: and there hauing
by espiall perfect notice that Sandwich was neither peopled nor fortified (because that
a little before, the rulers of the towne were from thense departed, for to auoid the
plague, which sore there afflicted and slue the people) he entered the hauen, spoiled
the towne, and after such poore stuffe as he there found rifled and taken, he fearing an

flies where no flap to fraie them) entered into Northumberland (king Iames the second
being there in person) &amp; burned certeine poore houses, and litte cottages: but in the
verie middest of their great enterprise, they hearing of the duke of Yorkes marching
toward them with a great host, with much paine and no gaine in all hast returned to
their countrie. But now to passe ouer outward inuasions, &amp; to intreat of the dailie
disorder amongest the nobles at home. So was it, that a great conflict fell betw&eacute;ene
the lord Egremond, &amp; the sonnes of the erle of Salisburie; in which manie persons
were slaine, &amp; a great number hurt. The lord Egremond, s&eacute;eking to get awaie but
could not, by force was taken &amp; brought before the councell: where the king and the
qu&eacute;ene, to shew themselues indifferent, adiudged him to paie to the earle of Salisburie
a great summe of monie; and for his heinous offense against the lawes, was committed
to Newgate in London, out of which he escaped, to the great trouble of the shiriffes.</p>

because the duke was in more estimation there, than either the king hir husband, or

was chieflie sought) were sent for to Couentr&eacute;e by the kings letters, vnder
his priuie seale, to which place the said lords without suspicion of danger obedientlie
resorted.</p>

<p>But being admonished by secret friends, what was intended against them, they by
flight auoided that danger, where otherwise their liues had b&eacute;ene lost without all
remedie. And so without bidding anie farewell, they departed from the court; the
duke vnto Wigmoore in the marches of Wales, the earle of Salisburie to his castell of
Middleham in the north, and the earle of Warwike sailed to Calis. The bodies of
which thr&eacute;e noble personages though thus separated, yet their hearts knit in one, and
still went messengers &amp; letters betwixt them, to communicat their deuises, and giue
signification of their minds and purposes.</p>

<p>In the name of the trinitie, father, sonne, and holie-ghost, I Reinold Peacocke bishop
of Chichester vnworthie, of mine owne power and will without anie maner coaction
or dread, confesse and knowledge that I here, before this time, presuming of my
naturall wit, and preferring my iudgement and naturall reason before the new and the
old testament, and the authoritie &amp; determination of our mother holie church, haue
held, written and taught otherwise than the holie Romane and vniuersall church
teacheth, preacheth, or obserueth. And one is against the true catholike and apostles

works, and writings, conteining heresies and errors, contrarie to the faith catholike,
and determination of holie church: and speciallie these heresies and errours following,
that is to saie in particular.</p>

<p>In primis, qu&ograve;d non est de necessitate fidei credere, qu&ograve;d dominus noster Iesus Christus
post mortem descendit ad inferos.</p>

<p>Item, qu&ograve;d non est de necessitate salutis credere in sanctorum communionem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;enes atturnie slain.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Iusting in the Tower of London.</div>

<p>In the moneth of Ianuarie died the earle of Deuonshire in the abbeie of Abindon,
poisoned (as men said) being there at that time with qu&eacute;ene Margaret, to appease
the malice betw&eacute;ene the yoong lords, whose fathers w&eacute;e slaine at saint Albons, and
they that held with the duke of Yorke. The thirt&eacute;enth of Aprill there was a great
fraie in Fl&eacute;etstr&eacute;et, betw&eacute;ene men of court and the inhabitants of the same str&eacute;et, in
which fraie the qu&eacute;enes atturnie was slaine. For this fact the king committed the
principall gouernours of Furniuals, Cliffords, and Barnards In to prison in the castell
of Hertford; and William Tailor alderman of that ward, with manie other were sent to
Windsor castell the seuenth of Maie. On thursdaie in Whitsunw&eacute;eke, the duke of
Summerset with Anthonie Riuers and other foure kept iustes before the qu&eacute;ene in the
Tower of London against thr&eacute;e esquiers of the qu&eacute;enes. And in like maner at Gr&eacute;enewich
the sundaie following.</p>

<p>King Henrie and his councell, perceiuing the duke of Yorke laie still and stirred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
not, returned to London, and there called a great councell, openlie declaring how the
French and Scots (imboldened by the ciuill discord within this realme) attempted to annoie
the same, as of late they had shewed apparant tokens, and likelie not ceasse vpon
occasions to doo further displeasures, till a perfect concord were concluded betw&eacute;ene
him and his fr&eacute;ends, and those of the contrarie part and confederacie. And to the
intent that he would be the ch&eacute;efe author of peace, he promised of his dignitie so
to interteine the duke of Yorke and his fr&eacute;ends, that all old grudges should be not
onelie inwardlie forgotten, but also outwardlie forgiuen, which should be cause of
perpetuall loue and assured amitie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The p&eacute;eres of the realme called to a treatie.</div>

<p>This deuise was of all men iudged for the best. Wherevpon diuerse graue persons
were sent to the duke of Yorke, and all other the great estates of the realme, who
since the battell of saint Albons neuer met nor communed togither, commanding
them for great causes to repaire to the kings court without delaie. At his commandement
came to London Richard duke of Yorke, with foure hundred men, and
was lodged at Bainards castell being his owne house; and after him came the earle of
Salisburie with fiue hundred men, and was likewise lodged at his owne house called
the Herbour. Then came the dukes of Excester and Summerset with eight hundred
men, and were lodged without Temple barre; and the earle of Northumberland, the
lord Egremond, and the lord Clifford came with fift&eacute;ene hundred men, and lodged
without the citie. The earle of Warwike also came from Calis with six hundred men
in red iackets, imbrodered with white ragged staues behind and before, and was lodged
at the graie friers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prouidence of the citie for safegard of peace.</div>

<p>Thus were all those of the one part lodged within the citie, and those of the other
without, in Holborne towards Westminster, and in other places of the suburbs, all
vpon wise consideration: for that the Yorke faction and the Lancastrians could not
well haue b&eacute;ene mingled without danger of discord. After that these lords were thus
come vnto London, the king and the qu&eacute;ene shortlie followed, comming thither the
seuent&eacute;enth daie of March, and lodged in the bishops palace. Bicause no riotous
attempt or bickering should be begun betw&eacute;ene anie of the parties or their retinues,
the maior and aldermen of the citie kept great watch, as well by daie as by night,
riding about the citie by Holborne, and Fl&eacute;etstr&eacute;et, with fiue thousand men well
armed and arraied, to s&eacute;e good order and peace on all sides kept.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lords are brought to agr&eacute;e.</div>

<p>The lords which lodged within the citie held a dailie councell at blacke friers; the
other part soiourning without the walles, assembled likewise in the chapiter house at
Westminster. At length by the diligent trauell and good exhortation of the archbishop
of Canturburie, and other prelats; both parties were persuaded to come to communication,
and so did. Where, after long debating of grieuances on both sides, they
promising to forget all old rancors, and to be fr&eacute;ends each to other, &amp; both obedient
to the king, were accorded by award, wherof writings were sealed, signed, and

<div class="sidenote">The clergie were sure in those daies to loose nothing by these contentions howsoeuer the world went.</div>

<p>First, that at the costs, charges, and expenses of the duke of Yorke, the earles
of Warwike, and Salisburie, fourtie &amp; fiue pounds of yearelie rent should be assured
by waie of a mortisement for euer, vnto the monasterie of S. Albons, for suffrages
and obits to be kept, and almes to be imploied for the soules of Edmund late duke of
Summerset, Henrie late erle of Northumberland, and Thomas late lord Clifford late
slaine in the battell of saint Albons, and buried in the abbeie church, and also for the
soules of all other slaine in the same battell. The said duke of Summerset, the earle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
of Northumberland, and lord Clifford, by vertue of the same award, were declared
for true and faithfull liegemen to the king, and so to be holden and reputed in the
daie of their deaths, aswell as the said duke of Yorke, the earles of Warwike and
Salisburie.</p>

<p>Moreouer it was decr&eacute;ed, that the duke of Yorke should giue to Elenor duchesse of
Summerset, and to Henrie duke of Summerset hir sonne, the summe of fiue thousand
markes of good assignements of debts, which the king owght him for his wages, due
during the time of his seruice in Ireland, to be diuided as the king should thinke
conuenient, betwixt the brethren &amp; sisters of the said duke of Summerset. Also that
the earle of Warwike should giue vnto the lord Clifford, the summe of a thousand
markes, in good and sufficient assignements of debts, which the king owght him, to
be distributed betwixt the said lord Clifford his brethren and sisters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Egremond.</div>

<p>Also where Thomas Persie knight, lord Egremond, and Richard Persie his brother,
sonnes of the ladie Elenor countesse of Northumberland, had b&eacute;en in a sessions holden
within the countie of Yorke before Richard Bingham, and Rafe Pole the kings iustices

of eight thousand markes; and to the same earle, and to his wife Alice in the summe
of fiue thousand marks; and to Thomas Neuill knight, son to the said earle of Salisburie,
in the summe of a thousand marks; and to the said Thomas and Mawd
his wife, in the summe of two thousand marks; and to Iohn Neuill knight, sonne
to the said earle of Salisburie, in the summe of eight hundred marks: for transgressions
and trespasses there found to be doone by the said lord Egremond, and Richard
his brother, vnto the said earle of Salisburie, Alice, Thomas Neuill, Mawd and Iohn
Neuill, as by the record app&eacute;ered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They were shiriffes, an. 1456.</div>

<p>It was ordeined, that the said earle and his sonnes should release all the said summes
of monie, and the executions thereof, and likewise release vnto Rafe Verneie, and
Iohn Steward late shiriffes of London, vnto whose custodie the said lord Egremond
had b&eacute;ene for the same condemnations committed and from them escaped, all actions
which they or anie of them might haue against the said Verneie and Steward for the
same escape. Yet it was decr&eacute;ed by this award, that the said lord Egremond should be
bound by recognisance in the chancerie, to k&eacute;epe the peace toward the said erle and
his wife, children, seruants, and tenants.</p>

<p>Also were diuerse knights, esquiers, and other seruants and tenants to the said earle
of Northumberland, and to the said lord Egremond, were by their seuerall obligations
bound, by occasion of the said debates, vnto the said duke of Yorke, earle of Salisburie,
or anie of their children, to stand to their order and gouernement; it was ordeined
that the same obligations should be deliuered to them that so stood bound, before
the feast of saint Peter ad vincula next insuing at the citie of Yorke; or else that
the parties so bound, should haue sufficient acquitances in discharge of the same obligations.</p>

<p>It was further awarded, that all variances, discords, debates, controuersies, appeales,
and actions personals, that were or had b&eacute;ene betwixt any of the said persons, or any
of their seruants, or tenants, should be for euer determined &amp; ended, sauing to euerie
one his title, action and right, which he had by any euidence of arrerages of rents or
seruices, accounts, detinues, or debts due by reason of anie lawfull contract or d&eacute;ed,
had and made for anie reasonable considerations, other than the variance before said.</p>

<p>And for the more assurance of both parties, it was ordeined that either should release
to other all maner of actions, that were m&eacute;ere personals and appeales, which
anie of them might haue against the other, by reason of the variances and discords
before mentioned.</p>

<p>Also it was decr&eacute;ed, that if anie action, sute or quarell chanced betwixt anie of

occasioned or mooued before this time; that from thenceforth, none of the said parties
should mainteine, support, or aid any of them that will so sue and mooue strife

quietnesse.</p>

<p>It was further awarded, that if anie man complained, pretended, or surmised, that
this award was not kept, but in some point broken by anie of the parties, for the which
breach he would haue a Scire facias, or some other action prosecuted in the kings name
vpon anie recognisance made to the king for the performance of this award: yet should
not the same Scire facias or action be prosecuted, till the kings councell might be

kings name.</p>

<p>And if anie variance rose betwixt the councell of both the parties in making of the
recognisances, releases, acquittances, or other writings; the same variance should be
determined by the two lords ch&eacute;efe iustices, that should be fullie instructed of the
kings intention in this behalfe.</p>

<p>And besides this, it was notified and declared by the same award, that the parties

that the same recognisances should stand in force, and no parcels of the summes

<p>And if anie of the said summes, or anie parcell thereof should be recouered by
action or execution taken and prosecuted in the kings name, vpon anie of the said

one halfe of the monie so recouered; and the other moitie should be assigned to the

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<p>For the open publishing of this ioifull agr&eacute;ement, there was (vpon our ladie daie
in March) a solemne procession celebrated within the cathedrall church of saint
Paule in London, at the which the king was present in habit roiall, with his crowne
on his head. Before him went hand in hand the duke of Summerset, the earle of
Salisburie, the duke of Excester, and the earle of Warwike; and so one of the one
faction, and another of the other: and behind the king the duke of Yorke, and the
qu&eacute;ene with great familiaritie in app&eacute;erance leading hand in hand. [But what shall be
said? As goodlie apples corrupted at core, (how faire coated so euer they s&eacute;eme) can
neuer be made to become sound againe: nor rotten walles new plastered without, can
euer the more staie their mooldering inward, till the putrified matter fret through the
crust laie all in the mire: so fared it on all parts in this dissembled and counterfet
concord.] For after this apparant peace (but inward discord) diuerse of the nobles
smallie regarding their honors, forgot their oth, and brake their promise boldlie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Warwike assaulted.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;enes purpose.</div>

<p>Not long after this, of pretensed purpose (as it was thought) a fraie was made
vpon a yeoman of the earle of Warwiks, by one of the kings seruants, in the which
the assailant was sore hurt, but the earles man fled. H&eacute;erevpon the kings meniall seruants,
s&eacute;eing their fellow hurt, and the offendor escaped, assembled togither and
watched the earle, when he returned from the councell chamber toward his barge,
and suddenlie set on him, the yeomen with swords, the blacke gard with spits and fierforks.
After long fight, and manie of the earls men maimed and hurt, by helpe of
his fr&eacute;ends he gat a wherrie, and so escaped to London. The qu&eacute;ene aduertised h&eacute;erof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
incontinentlie commanded that he should be apprehended and committed to the tower,
where (if he had b&eacute;ene taken) he had shortlie ended his daies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Warwike lord admerall.</div>

<p>By this vnhappie fraie, there arose anon after such trouble and terrible warre, that
the whole realme was thereby disquieted. For after this displeasure doone to the
earle, and the qu&eacute;enes good mind towards him by his secret fr&eacute;ends reuealed; he with
all diligence tooke his iournie to Warwike, and after into Yorkeshire, where he found
the duke of Yorke, and the earle of Salisburie, declaring vnto them the assault made
vpon him by the kings seruants, and the pretensed euill purpose of the qu&eacute;ene. After
which complaint made, he fearing to be dispossessed of his roome at Calis, with great
sp&eacute;ed imbarked himselfe and sailed thither. He was not onelie deputie or lieutenant
of Calis, but also high admerall of the seas, which office was to him confirmed for
the space of fiue yeares. Wherevpon, whether before his arriuall now at Calis, or
shortlie after, I cannot say; but this yeare about the middest of summer, the said earle,
hauing with him a fouret&eacute;ene well appointed ships, sailed abroad to scowre the seas,
and by chance met with fiue great ships, whereof thr&eacute;e were caraks of Genoa, and
the other two were of Spaine, bigger in heigth and length than the caraks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A rich prise.</div>

<p>The earle, though he was scarse able to deale against them, yet he valiantlie incountred
them. There was a verie sore and long continued battell fought betwixt
them, for it lasted almost the space of two daies. Yet in the end the victorie fell to
the English, so that two of those ships being forced to saue themselues by flight, the
other thr&eacute;e were taken, which the earle brought vnto Calis, with all the merchandize
aboord the same; the value whereof in wine, oile, wax, iron, cloth of gold, and
other riches, was est&eacute;emed to the summe of ten thousand pounds &amp; aboue. By reason
whereof, that was sold now for twelue pense, which would not haue b&eacute;ene bought
before for two shillings. There were taken a great number of prisoners, beside a
thousand of the enimies slaine in fight. Of the earles part there were fiftie slaine.
The earles fame h&eacute;ereby increased not a little, and manie a blessing he had for this
p&eacute;ece of seruice.</p>

after which time it was likewise practised in the abbies of S. Augustine at Canturburie,
saint Albons, and other monasteries of England. In a little towne in Bedfordshire
there fell a bloudie raine, whereof the red drops app&eacute;ered in sh&eacute;ets, the which a woman

<p>But now to the former purpose. After that the earle was gone ouer to Calis, the
duke of Yorke and the earle of Salisburie, falling in consultation togither, it was at
length agr&eacute;ed betwixt them, with aduise of their fr&eacute;ends, that the said earle of Salisburie
with a warlike companie should march toward the king; and signifie to him by
waie of complaint, both the manifest iniurie doone to his sonne, and also the vncourteous
breach of the sworne amitie and late agr&eacute;ement. In which sute if he preuailed,
he should not then let passe the occasion giuen for reuenge of displeasures to him
doone, both by the qu&eacute;ene and hir sinister councellors. After conclusion of this
deuise, the earle of Salisburie remooued from Middleham castell, accompanied with
foure or fiue thousand men, and tooke his waie through Lancashire, to passe that waie
towards London.</p>

Warwike had kindled this fier, to the intent to set the crowne on the duke of Yorks

those parties by the which the earle of Salisburie must passe) to raise an hoast of men
with all sp&eacute;ed, and to giue battell to the same earle, if he saw cause and place conuenient.

construing that they ment no good, neither to hir nor hir husband, requested the lord

faire plaine called Bloreheath, within a mile of a towne called Draiton in Shropshire.
The earle, perceiuing in what ieopardie he stood, determined to abide the aduenture
with fame and honour, rather than to flie with shame and reproach; and so incamped
himselfe all the night on the side of a little brooke, not verie brode, but somewhat
d&eacute;epe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The 23 of September.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Policie oft times passeth force.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Audelie slaine.</div>

<p>In the morning earlie, being the daie of saint Tecle, he caused his souldiers to shoot
their flights towards the lord Audelies companie, which laie on the other side of the
said water, and then he and all his people made a signe of retreit. The lord Audelie,
supposing his aduersaries had fled in d&eacute;ed, caused his trumpets quicklie to blow vp,
and setting foorth his voward, sp&eacute;edilie passed the water. The earle of Salisburie,
which knew the sleights of warlike policie, suddenlie returned, and set vpon the lord
Audelie and his ch&eacute;efe capteins, yer the residue of his armie could passe the water.
The fight was sore and dreadfull. The earle desiring the sauing of his life, and his
aduersaries coueting his destruction, fought sore for the obteining of their purpose:
but in conclusion, the earles armie, as men not looking for other succours nor meane
to escape, but by their owne manhood, so egerlie assaulted their foes, that they slue
the lord Audelie and all his capteins, and discomfited all the remnant of his people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The number slaine in the battell of Bloreheath.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Salisburies sonne apprehended.</div>

<p>In this battell were slaine foure and twentie hundred persons, but the greatest losse fell
vpon the Chesshire men, bicause one halfe of the shire was on the one part, and the other
halfe on the other: of which number were sir Thomas Dutton, sir Iohn Doune and
sir Hugh Venables, sir Richard Molineux, sir William Trowtbecke, sir Iohn Legh of
the Both, and sir Iohn Egerton, knights; Iohn Done, and Iohn Dutton esquiers.
But the earles two sonnes, the one called sir Iohn Neuill, and the other sir Thomas
Neuill, were sore wounded, the which soberlie iornieng into the north countrie, were
apprehended by the qu&eacute;enes fr&eacute;ends, and togither with sir Thomas Harington that was
likewise taken, were conueied to Chester; but their k&eacute;epers deliuered them shortlie
after, or else had the Marchmen destroied the goales. Such fauour bare the commons
of Wales to the duke of Yorks band, that they could not suffer anie wrong to be
offered, or euill word to be spoken against him or his fr&eacute;ends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorke assembleth an armie.</div>

<p>After this battell at Bloreheath, the said duke of Yorke, perceiuing the destruction
of him and his fr&eacute;ends was intended, and that his deuises were alreadie disclosed to
the king and the qu&eacute;ene, he thought now no longer to linger his businesse, but with
all diligence to set forward the same. And therfore sending for his ch&eacute;efe fr&eacute;end the
earle of Salisburie, after long conference of their weightie affaires, they determined
to raise an armie, and by fine force either to win their purpose, or end their liues in
the same. H&eacute;erevpon were men foorthwith assembled, fr&eacute;ends sent for, and a puissant
armie gathered, both of Northerne and Welshmen, who in good order came into
the marches of Wales adioining to Shropshire, determining there to abide their enimies,
or to m&eacute;et them; if occasion serued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Andrew Trollop.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Iohn Blunt.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king raiseth an armie.</div>

<p>There came to him from Calis the earle of Warwike bringing with him from that
towne a great number of expert men in martiall feates, whereof two were capteins
knowne for men of great experience and approoued policie, as they had well declared
the same in the warres of Normandie and Guien, the one called Andrew Trollop,
and the other Iohn Blunt. The king, hauing aduertisement of the dukes dooings,
sent foorth commissioners to leuie a power in all parts of the realme, where he
thought to haue any faithfull fr&eacute;ends or fauourers: by reason whereof a great number
of men of warre was assembled. Manie for the loue they bare to the king resorted to his
side, but more for feare of the qu&eacute;enes displesure, whose frowning countenance was their
vndooing, and hir indignation their death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop of Salisburie sent to the duke of Yorke and others.</div>

<p>To be br&eacute;efe, the king accompanied with the dukes of Summerset and Excester, and
other of the line of Lancaster, determined either by force or by policie to bring
the duke of Yorke to confusion; and therevpon marching forward they came vnto
Worcester, where as well to refresh his people, as to take further aduise what was best
to be doone, he staied for a time. And at length it was determined, that the K. should
first send vnto the aduersaries, a messenger of good account, as the bishop of Salisburie
Richard Beauchampe, to offer vnto them a cl&eacute;ere and fr&eacute;e generall pardon of all
trespasses, offenses, and transgressions whatsoeuer; if they would giue ouer their enterprise,
and become true and obedient subiects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their answer touching the pardon offred.</div>

<p>When the bishop was come vnto them, and had declared his message, they first
withdrew themselues apart, and fell togither in councell: and after they gaue answer
by the mouth of the erle of Warwike, which consisted in thr&eacute;e points. First, that
as concerning the pardon, they durst not trust vnto it, considering they had diuerse
pardons before, and the same confirmed by parlement, and yet nothing auaileable to
their assurance. Secondlie, that notwithstanding such pardons, those that were about
the king, were persumptuous and vnrulie, that they cared not at all to breake the
kings commandements, nor were any thing abashed to be noted for the breach thereof.</p>

<p>Thirdlie, although by law of the land, and right of the statute, euerie lord by vertue
of the kings writ, being called to the parlement, ought safelie to come, safelie
there to remaine, and safelie to depart and returne home: this notwithstanding, the
said earle of Warwike himselfe, at a certeine councell holden at Westminster, by
vertue of the kings writ of priuie seale, being there in person, &amp; labouring to his
knowledge to giue good aduise and councell for the profit of the common-wealth, was
yet in danger of death, if the Lord aboue had not the better prouided for his escape,
more than anie humane power or force of the kings pardon. "For the which cause
(quoth he) sith the kings pardon maie be likened in these daies to a buckler of glasse,
or to a staffe of r&eacute;ed, in which is no trust, we dare not commit our selues vnto the defense
of anie such pardons." But if anie other waie might be deuised for their suerties,
wherevnto they might safelie trust (he said) they were readie to come to his grace, and
to sue for his fauour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A letter from the lords to the king.</div>

<p>The king receiuing such answer in these words, or other to the like effect, was
nothing contented therewith, and so commanded his standards eftsoones to aduance.
But yet before he came n&eacute;ere to the place where they were incamped, the said lords
wrote to him a letter in their owne excuse, protesting they meant no harme in the
world against his person, as by their demeanors and proc&eacute;edings it might well appeare,
who had euer fled &amp; withdrawne themselues from place to place, from towne to towne,
from village to village, and from countie to countie. Which might serue for an
euident token, that they sought for nothing but onelie their owne safegards &amp; quietnesse
of the realme, with so much fauour, as in good and safe suertie they might
come to his presence, to declare certeine things which in their opinions might turne to
the wealth of the realme: and further to make answer to all things that had b&eacute;ene
obiected against them. And now (said they) we are here remaining in the vttermost
parts of the land (that is) in the marches towards Wales, not farre from Ludlow, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
vpon anie presumptuous meaning, but rather in all humble lowlinesse of mind and
bodie to abide his graces comming: which they besought of God might be in some
peaceable maner and fauourable in their behalfes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A proclamation.</div>

<p>The king hauing receiued this letter, and coniecturing that some bitter meaning laie
vnder so sw&eacute;et a sp&eacute;ech, co&#x0304;manded his armie againe to march foorth; and comming
within halfe a mile of the aduersaries campe, pitched downe his field, and foorthwith
caused proclamation to be made, that who so euer of his aduersaries would giue ouer
his lewd begun enterprise, and repaire to his presence to sue for mercie, he would
pardon him of all offenses. This proclamation, comming to the vnderstanding of
them in the duke of Yorks hoast, caused a great number that were there with him
against the king, to get awaie &amp; come to the kings side. Moreouer, there rose among
the residue great murmuring: so as they s&eacute;emed verie like to grow to a gr&eacute;euous mutinie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Andrew Trollop forsaketh the lords.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<p>Amongst other of those that came to the kings campe, Andrew Trollop was ch&eacute;efe,
who with the other Calisians, which had long serued the king, and liued a long time
by his wages, perceiuing now that they should fight against their souereigne lord himselfe
(whose true subject they est&eacute;emed before that time the earle of Warwike euer to
haue b&eacute;ene, and in no wise his enimie) in the dead of the night before the daie of
the battell secretlie departed from the dukes campe, and submitted themselues to the
king, admonishing him of all things deuised against him. Wherof part was, that the
duke of Yorke by his expert capteins appointed vpon a waie how to set vpon his
enimies, &amp; easilie to discomfitt them; so as on the next morning he meant to haue assailed
the king and his people, yer they could haue b&eacute;ene readie or warie of his comming.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The estimation of Andrew Trollop.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorke and his complices fl&eacute;e.</div>

<p>But now by the going awaie thus of his capteins and people, that purpose was
disappointed. And Andrew Trollop thus departed, he was now as much discomforted,
as before by trust in him he was incouraged: for all his councell and purpose by
Andrew disclosed, he thought it better for him &amp; his to depart in suertie, than to abide
the imminent danger. Whervpon he with his yoonger sonne Edmund earle of Rutland,
secretlie fled into Wales, and so passed into Ireland, where he was with all ioy and
honour gladlie receiued, all the Irish offering to liue and die with him; as if they had
b&eacute;ene his liege subiects, and he their lord and prince naturallie borne.</p>

<p>The earle of March sonne and heire apparant to the said duke, accompanied with
the earles of Salisburie and Warwike, and sir Iohn Wenlocke, got awaie the same
night, and came into Deuonshire: where, by the meanes of Iohn Dinham esquier
(which after was high treasuror of England, in the daies of king Henrie the seauenth)
they bought a ship which cost a hundred and ten marks at Exmouth, and sailed into
Gerneseie, after came to Calis, where being let in at the posterne, they were ioifullie
welcomed of their fr&eacute;ends, namelie of sir William Neuill lord Fauconbridge, that was
the earle of Warwikes vncle, and brother to the earle of Salisburie, who had the
towne and castell in k&eacute;eping. All these being assembled cast their heads togither,
and euerie one seuerallie had his deuise for the perfecting of their purpose, whereto
there wanted in them neither will nor hardinesse.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The lords proclamed traitors.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Summerset made capteine of Calis.</div>

<p>But now to returne to the king. When in the morning he was aduertised that the
duke of Yorke and his partakers were fled and gone, he caused all his horssemen to
follow them; although in vaine: for they were got farre enough out of danger (as
before ye haue heard.) The king pardoned all the poore souldiers, sauing certeine
ringleaders; of the which some he punished and fined, and some he hanged and quartered.
After this he remooued to Ludlow, and there brake vp his host, and spoiling
the towne and castell, he sent the duchesse of Yorke with hir two yoong sonnes to be
kept in ward with the duchesse of Buckingham hir sister. This doone, he proclamed
these lords, traitors to him, enimies to their countrie, and rebels to the crowne, confiscating
their lands, goods, and offices: and committed the gouernance of the north
parts to the earle of Northumberland, and to the lord Clifford, as to his trustie and
most faithfull fr&eacute;ends, &amp; of his towne of Calis he made capteine Henrie the new duke
of Summerset.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hastie heading.</div>

<p>This duke reioising much in his new office, chose foorth diuerse valiant and hardie
souldiers, and with great pompe shortlie after tooke the seas, and sailed towards Calis.
But when he thought to haue entred the hauen, the artillerie shot so hotlie, both out
of the towne, and from Risebanke, that he suffering there a sore repulse, was faine to
land at Whitsandbaie; and sent word to the capteins of the towne to receiue him as
the kings lieutenant, shewing to them his letters patents. But neither he nor his
writing was once regarded: and so of necessitie he resorted to the castell of Guisnes,
dailie skirmishing with the garrison of Calis, more to his losse than gaine. Diuerse of
the mariners of those ships that went ouer with him, after his arriuall, owing more
good will to the earle of Warwike than to this yoong duke, conueied their ships into
the hauen of Calis, and in them diuerse of the earle of Warwikes enimies, as Iamin
Findill, Iohn Felow, and diuerse others, the which being presented vnto the earle of
Warwike, he caused their heads foorth with to be striken off.</p>

<p>Shortlie after, Richard lord Riuers, and sir Anthonie Wooduile his valiant sonne
that was after lord Scales, accompanied with foure hundred warlike persons, were
appointed to passe over to Guisnes, to aid the duke of Summerset against his aduersaries,
which laie in Calis. But as they soiourned at Sandwich abiding for wind and
weather to transport them ouer, the earles of March and Warwike had knowledge
thereof, and sent Iohn Dinham with a small number of men (but a multitude of
valiant hearts) vnto the towne of Sandwich, which suddenlie entered the same, and
tooke the lord Riuers and his sonne also in their beds, robbing houses, and spoiling
ships. And beside this, they tooke the principall ships of the kings nauie, and had
them awaie with them to Calis [one excepted called Grace de Dieu which might not
be had awaie bicause she was broken in the bottome] and there presented them to the
earle of March, of whome he was ioifullie receiued. For though in the fight he was
sore hurt &amp; maimed in the leg, so as he halted euer after, yet he bare himselfe so
worthilie in that enterprise, that his praise was great amongst all men.</p>

<p>&para; Sir Baldwine Fulford vndertooke on paine of loosing his head, that he would

monie, he returned againe. After this good fortune thus chanced to the lords, diuerse
of the best ships taken in the hauen of Sandwich, were well vittelled and
manned, and with them the earle of Warwike sailed into Ireland, to common with
the duke of Yorke of their great affaires and businesse. The weather and wind were
so fauourable to the earles purpose, that within lesse than thirtie daies he passed and
repassed from Calis to Dublin, and backe againe.</p>

<p>2 Item, the pouertie and miserie that to our great heauinesse our souereigne lord
standeth in, not hauing anie liuelod of the crowne of England whereof he may k&eacute;epe
his honorable houshold, which causeth the spoiling of his said liege men by the takers
of his said houshold, which liuelod is in their hands that haue b&eacute;ene destroiers of his
said estate, and of the said common-weale.</p>

<p>3 Item, how his lawes be parciallie and vnrightfullie guided, and that by them that
should most loue and tender his said lawes, the said oppression and extortion is most
fauoured and supported; and generallie, that all righteousnesse and iustice is exiled
out of the said land, and that no man dreadeth to offend against the said lawes.</p>

<p>4 Item, that it will please his said good grace to liue vpon his owne liuelod, wherevpon
his noble progenitors haue in daies heretofore liued as honorablie and as worthilie
as anie christian princes, and not to suffer the destroiers of the said land, and of his true
subiects, to liue therevpon, and therefore to lacke the sustenances that should be belonging
to his said estate, and find his said houshold vpon his poore commons, without
paiement, which neither accordeth with Gods nor mans law.</p>

<p>5 Item, how oft the said commons haue b&eacute;ene greatlie and maruellouslie charged
with taxes and tallages to their great impouerishing, whereof little good hath either
growne to the king or to the said land, and of the most substance thereof the king
hath left to his part not halfe so much; and other lords and persons, enimies to the
said common-weale, haue to their owne vse, suffering all the old possessions that the
king had in France and Normandie, Aniou and Maine, Gascoine, and Guien, woone
and gotten by his father of most noble memorie, and other his noble progenitors, to
be shamefullie lost or sold.</p>

<p>6 Item, how they can not ceasse therewith, but now begin a new charge of imposition
and tallages vpon the said people, which neuer afore was s&eacute;ene; that is to saie,
euerie towneship to find men for the kings gard, taking example therein of our enimies
and aduersaries of France. Which imposition &amp; tallage, if it be continued to heire,
heires, and successors, will be the heauiest charge and worst example that euer grew in
England; and the foresaid subiects, and the said heires and successors in such bondage,
as their ancestors were neuer charged with.</p>

<p>7 Item, where the king hath now no more liuelod out of his realme of England, but
onelie the land of Ireland, and the towne of Calis, and that no king christened hath
such a land and a towne without his realme; diuerse lords haue caused his highnesse to
write letters vnder his priuie seale, vnto his Irish enimies, which neuer king of England
did heretofore, wherby they may haue comfort to enter into the conquest of the
said land, which letters the same Irish enimies sent vnto me the said duke of Yorke,
and maruelled greatlie that anie such letters should be to them sent, speaking therin
great shame and villanie of the said realme.</p>

<p>8 Item, in like wise the king by excitation and labour of the same lords, wrote
other letters to his enimies and aduersaries in other lands, that in no wise they should
shew anie fauour or good will to the towne of Calis, whereby they had comfort inough
to proc&eacute;ed to the winning thereof. Considered also, that it is ordeined by the labour
of the said lords, that no where vittels nor other thing of refreshing or defense should
come out of England, to the succour or reliefe of the said towne, to the intent that
they would haue it lost, as it may openlie appeare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>9 Item, it is d&eacute;emed and ought greatlie to be d&eacute;emed, that after the same lords
would put the same rule of England, if they might haue their purpose and intent, into
the hands and gouernance of the said enimies.</p>

<p>10 Item, how continuallie since the pitious, shamefull, and sorrowfull murther to all
England, of that noble, worthie, and christian prince Humfreie duke of Glocester
the kings true vncle, at Burie, it hath b&eacute;ene laboured, studied and conspired, to haue
destroied and murthered the said duke of Yorke, and the issue that it pleased God
to send me of the roiall bloud, and also of vs the said earles of Warwike and Salisburie,
for none other cause but for the true hart that (God knoweth) we euer
haue borne, and beare to the profit of the kings estate, to the common-weale of the
same realme, and defense thereof.</p>

<p>11 Item, how the earles of Shrewesburie and Wilshire, and the lord Beaumont,
our mortall and extreme enimies now, and of long time past, hauing the guiding
about the most noble person of our said souereigne lord, whose highnesse they haue
restreined &amp; kept from the libertie &amp; fr&eacute;edome that belongeth to his said estate, &amp;
the supporters &amp; fauourers of all the premisses, would not suffer the kings said good
grace to receiue and accept vs, as he would haue doone, if he might haue had his
owne will, into his said presence, dreading the charge that would haue b&eacute;ene laid
vpon them, of the miserie, destruction, and wretchednesse of the said realme,
whereof they be causes, and not the king, which is himselfe as noble, as vertuous, as
righteous and blessed of disposition, as anie prince earthlie.</p>

<p>12 Item, the earles of Wilshire and Shrewesburie, and the lord Beaumont, not satisfied
nor content with the kings possessions and his goods, stirred and excited his said
highnesse to hold his parlement at Couentrie, where an act is made by their prouocation
and labour, against vs the said duke of Yorke, my sonnes March and Rutland, and
the earles of Warwike and Salisburie, and the sonnes of the said earle of Salisburie, and
manie other knights and esquiers of diuerse matters falselie and vntrulie imagined, as
they will answer afore almightie God in the daie of doome; the which the said earles of
Shrewesburie &amp; Wilshire, and the lord Beaumont prouoked to be made, to the intent of
our destruction and of our issue; and that they might haue our liuelod and goods, as
they haue openlie robbed and despoiled all our places and our tenements, and manie other
true men, and now proc&eacute;ed to hanging and drawing of men by tyrannie, and will
therin shew the largenesse of their violence and malice as vengeablie as they can, if
no remedie be prouided at the kings highnes, whose blessednes is neither assenting
nor knowing thereof.</p>

<p>We therefore, s&eacute;eing all the said michiefes, hearing also that the French king maketh
in his land great assemblie of his people, which is greatlie to be dread for manie
causes, purpose yet againe with Gods grace to offer vs to come againe to the said presence
of our said souereigne lord to open and declare vnto him there, the mischiefes
aboue declared; and in the name of the land to sue, in as reuerent and lowlie wise as
we can, to his said good grace, to haue pittie and compassion vpon his said true subiects,
and not to suffer the same mischiefs to reigne vpon them. Requiring you in
Gods behalfe, and praieng you in our owne, therein to assist vs, dooing alwaie the dutie
of liege men in our persons to our souereigne lord, to his estate, prerogatiue, and
preheminence, and to the suertie of his most noble person, wherevnto we haue euer
b&eacute;ene and will be as true as anie of his subiects aliue, whereof we call God, our ladie
saint Marie, and all the saints in heauen to witnesse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Wilshire stale ouer the seas.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Priuie seales for monie.</div>

<p>In the meane time, the earle of Wilshire treasuror of England, the lord Scales &amp; the
lord Hungerford went to Newberie, which belonged to the duke of Yorke, and there
made inquisition of all them that in anie wise had fauoured the said duke; whereof some
were found guiltie, and were drawen, hanged, and quartered, and all the inhabitants
of the towne were spoiled of their goods. From thence the earle of Wilshire went to
Southampton; where, vnder colour to take the earle of Warwike, he armed fiue great
caracks of Iene with souldiers, taking vittels of the kings price without paiment, and
put a great part of his treasure into the said caracks, and after sailed about in the sea,
and at last stale into Dutchland, sending backe againe his souldiers into England.
Then were the kings priuie seales directed to all bishops, abbats, priors, and other
states, to lend the king monie, therewith to wage souldiers to k&eacute;epe the sea coasts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Flem.</i></div>

<p>After the kings nauie was gained, and his capteins (as before y&eacute;e haue heard) on the
sea taken; the lords lieng at Calis, being aduertised from the lord Fauconbridge (who
after the taking of Montford laie still in Kent) that the people of that countrie and
other parts were altogither bent in their fauour [and no lesse addicted to doo them seruice
both with bodie and goods, than the Irishmen s&eacute;emed to be at their receiuing of
the said duke of Yorke, and his yoonger sonne Edmund earle of Rutland, whom they
so highlie honoured, that they offered to liue and die in their quarell] they conceiued
therevpon so great hope in their fr&eacute;ends within the realme, that they determined to
passe the sea, and therewith entring their ships with fift&eacute;ene hundred men landed all
at Sandwich.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl. ex I. S. pag. 697.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The men of Kent sent to Calis for the earles.</div>

<p>[But it is to be read in a late writer, that the commons of Kent dreading the like
vengeance towards them, as fell vpon them of Newburie, sent priuilie messengers to
Calis to the foresaid erles, bes&eacute;eching them in all hast possible to come to their succour.
Wherevpon the said earles sent ouer into Kent the lord Fauconbridge, to know
if their d&eacute;eds would accord with their words: so that anon the people of Kent and the
other shires adioining, resorted to the said lord Fauconbridge in great number.
Wherefore when the earles knew the willing harts of those people, they prepared to
come into this land. Against whose comming, a long ballet was fixed vpon the gates
of Canturburie, made in fauour of the duke of Yorke and the said earles, beginning
thus: In the daie of fast and spirituall affliction, the celestiall influence of bodies
transitorie, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">1460</div>

<p>Now as they passed through Kent, there came to them the lord Cobham, Iohn Gilford,
William Pech, Robert Horne, and manie other gentlemen; so that before they
approched to London, their number was est&eacute;emed aboue fourtie thousand fighting men
for the fame of their landing being once knowen, gentlemen and yeomen resorted to
them out of all the south parts of the relme. Vpon which rumor, Thomas lord Scales,
a man in great fauour with the king &amp; qu&eacute;ene, accompanied with the earle of Kendall
a Gascoigne, and the lord Louell, resorted to London with a great companie of armed
men, declaring to the maior, that their repaire onelie was to defend and k&eacute;epe the
citie from spoile of such traitors as the king was credible informed were thither comming.
To whom the maior answered, that he n&eacute;eded no fellow helper, either to defend
or gouerne the citie to him committed in charge. With which answer the lord
Scales and his associats nothing contented, entred into the Tower, dailie deuising waies
how to grieue the citizens, whom he perceiued to fauour rather the duke of Yorks part
than the kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Couentrie the qu&eacute;enes secret harbour.</div>

<p>But shortlie after the earles of March and Warwike, and other of their affinitie,
came to London, and were of the maior and citizens ioiouslie receiued, to whome
resorted Thomas archbishop of Canturburie, the bishops of London, Lincolne, Salisburie,
Elie, and Excester, with manie other prelats and religious persons: amongst
whome also was the popes legat to treat of peace, if n&eacute;ed so required. Vpon good
deliberation and aduise had and taken amongst these lords how to go forward with
their weightie enterprise, the earles of March and Warwike, William lord Fauconbridge,
Henrie lord Bourchier, called earle of Eu, with a great number of men which
came out of Kent, Essex, Surrie, and Sussex, to the number (as some writers affirme)
of fiue and twentie thousand persons, departed from London toward the king lieng at
Couentrie, then called the qu&eacute;enes secret harbour, leauing behind them to k&eacute;epe the
Londoners in their promised fr&eacute;endship, the earle of Salisburie, the lord Cobham, and
sir Iohn Wenlocke, which tooke such order, and watched the gates and entries on ech
side so diligentlie, that no succours might come to the lord Scales lodging in the tower;
who tooke therewith such displeasure, that he shot out his great ordinance against
them within the citie, and they likewise shot at him againe, to the hurt and no pleasure
of both parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;ene the better capteine.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wethamsted.</i></div>

<p>The king hauing knowledge of all these dooings, assembled a great armie, and
accompanied with the duke of Summerset (latelie come from Guisnes) and the duke
of Buckingham, and diuerse other great lords that tooke his part, came to Northampton;
where the qu&eacute;ene perceiuing hir puissance to be able to match in fight with the
aduersaries, tooke vpon hir to incourage hir fr&eacute;ends and well-willers: for the king
studied of nothing but of peace, quietnesse, and solitarie life. When the whole hoast
of the kings part was assembled, the same issued foorth of the towne, and passing
ouer the riuer of Tine, lodged in the new field betw&eacute;ene Harsington and Sandifford,
stronglie fensing themselues about with high banks, and d&eacute;epe trenches. On the
other part, the lords being herewith aduanced verie n&eacute;ere the place where the kings
people laie without Northampton; the bishops that were there with them, by the aduise
and consent of the said lords, sent vnto the king the bishop of Salisburie, to vnderstand
his mind, and to mooue him vnto some treatie of peace, and to admit the archbishop
of Canturburie, and the other bishops there present, to be mediatours in the
matter, that some good accord might be concluded betwixt the parties, so as an
vniuersall peace might be restored in all parts through the whole realme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The battell of Northampto&#x0304;.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wethamsted.</i></div>

<p>The bishop of Salisburie dooing this message not so circumspectlie as had b&eacute;ene
conuenient, returned without bringing anie towardlie answer; but rather words of
high despite and vtter defiance. For the lords that were about the king, trusting in
their warlike engines and strength of place, in which they were incamped, though
otherwise inferior in number of men, purposed to abide the brunt of battell; and so
led with the spirit of rashnesse, sent none other answer backe againe by the bishop,
but contumelious words sounding greatlie to the reproch of their aduersaries; who
being sore offended therewith determined to s&eacute;eke reuenge with dint of sword. The
earle of March as then being in the floure of his lustie and most couragious youth,
lieng betw&eacute;ene Toucetor and Northampton, determined to set on the kings armie
without longer delaie: and therevpon in the night season remooued his campe toward
Northampton, and in marching forward set his men in order of battell: whereof the
vant-ward was led by the earle of Warwike, which either by strength or stealth wan a
streict which the lord Beaumont kept, going toward the kings campe; and herewith
entring freshlie with his people, began the battell about seauen of the clocke the
ninth daie of Iulie. After him followed the earle of March with the banner of his
father. &para; Others write, that the earle of March led the fore-ward, the erle of Warwike
the middleward, and the lord Fauconbridge the rere-ward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings part discomfited.</div>

<p>Moreouer, that Edmund lord Greie of Ruthen who was on the kings side, failed in
the trust committed to him: for where the enimies could not (without great danger)
enter vpon the kings campe, by reason of a mightie trench and rampire pight full of
piles and sharpe stakes, wherewith the campe was compassed about: the said lord
Graie came with his men, and with helping hands pulled the enimies vp, and receiued
them into the field where the battell was begun with great force &amp; violence. For
being now entred the field, they set vpon the kings people so fiercelie, that it s&eacute;emed
they ment either to obteine the victorie, or to die for it, euen all the whole number of
them. The fight continued right fierse and cruell, with vncerteine victorie, till the
houre of nine: at which time the kings armie was discomfited, and of the same slaine
and drowned in the riuer, few lesse than ten thousand; and the king himselfe left
comfortlesse alone was taken by the aduersaries, as a man in great miserie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tower deliuered to the earle of March.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Scales slaine.</div>

<p>At this battell fought at Northampton, were slaine Humfreie duke of Buckingham,
Iohn Talbot earle of Shrewesburie, a valiant person, and not degenerating from his noble
parents, Thomas lord Egremond, Iohn viscont Beaumont, and sir William Lucie, which
made great hast to come to part of the fight, and at his first approch was striken in
the head with an ax. Besides these that were slaine, manie were taken prisoners,
bicause they left their horsses, alighting to fight on foot. The duke of Summerset, and
other, which narrowlie escaped, fled with the qu&eacute;ene and prince into the bishoprike of
Durham. The earles, hauing got the victorie in this bloudie battell, conueied the
king to London, and lodged him in the bishops palace. After whose comming to the
citie, the Tower was deliuered to the erle of March, vpon a certeine composition; but
the lord Scales suspecting the sequele of the deliuerie thereof, tooke a wherrie priuilie,
intending to haue fled to the qu&eacute;ene; but he was espied by diuerse watermen belonging
to the earle of Warwike (which waited for his foorth comming on the Thames)
and suddenlie taken, was shortlie slaine with manie darts &amp; daggers, and his bodie left
naked and all bloudie at the gate of the clinke, and after was buried in the church adioining.</p>

<p>Then were diuerse persons apprehended, and indited of treason, wherof some were
pardoned, and some executed. Thomas Thorpe second baron of the escheker, was
committed to the Tower, where he remained long after, for that he was knowne to be
great fr&eacute;end to the house of Lancaster. &para; When qu&eacute;ene Margaret heard that the K.
was taken, she with hir sonne, and eight persons fled to the castell of Hardlagh in
Wales, and was robbed by the waie in Lancashire of all hir goods, to the value of ten
thousand markes: from thence she went into Scotland. Thus you s&eacute;e what fruits the
tr&eacute;e of ciuill discord dooth bring foorth; that euill tr&eacute;e, which whilest some haue
taken paine to plant, and some to proine and nourish, for others confusion (to whome
they haue giuen a taste of those apples which it bare, far more bitter than coloquintida)
themselues haue b&eacute;ene forced to take such share as befell them by lot. For as it is
not possible that a common fier, whose heat &amp; flame is vniuersallie spred, should spare
any particular place (for so should it not be generall) no more is it likelie that in ciuill
commotions, rebellions, insurrections, and partakings in conflicts and pitched f&eacute;elds
(speciallie vnder ringleaders of great countenance and personage, such as be the p&eacute;eres
and states of kingdoms) anie one should, though perhaps his life, yet (a thousand to
one) not saue his bloud vnspilt, nor his goods vnspoiled.] During this trouble, a
parlement was summoned to begin at Westminster, in the moneth of October next
following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A strange demeanor of the duke of Yorke.</div>

<p>In the meane time the duke of Yorke, aduertised of all these things, sailed from
Dubline towards England, and landed at the red bank n&eacute;ere to the citie of Chester,
with no small companie: and from Chester by long iournies he came to the citie of
London, which he entred the fridaie before the feast of S. Edward, the Confessor,
with a sword borne naked before him, with trumpets also sounding, and accompanied
with a great traine of men of armes, and other of his fr&eacute;ends and seruants. At his
comming to Westminster he entred the palace, and passing foorth directlie through
the great hall, staied not till he came to the chamber, where the king and lords vsed
to sit in the parlement time, commonlie called the vpper house, or chamber of the
p&eacute;eres, and being there entred, stept vp vnto the throne roiall, and there laieng his
hand vpon the cloth of estate, s&eacute;emed as if he meant to take possession of that
which was his right (for he held his hand so vpon that cloth a good pretie while) and
after withdrawing his hand, turned his face towards the people, beholding their
preassing togither, and marking what countenance they made.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">His bold sp&eacute;ech.</div>

<p>Whilest he thus stood and beheld the people, supposing they reioiced to s&eacute;e his presence,
the archbishop of Canturburie (Thomas Bourcher) came to him, &amp; after due
salutations, asked him if he would come and s&eacute;e the king. With which demand he
s&eacute;eming to take disdaine, answered br&eacute;efelie, and in few words thus: I remember
not that I know anie within this realme, but that it bes&eacute;emeth him rather to come and
s&eacute;e my person, than I to go and s&eacute;e his. The archbishop hearing his answer, went
backe to the king, and declared what answer he had receiued of the dukes owne
mouth. After the archbishop was departed to the king that laie in the qu&eacute;enes lodging,
the duke also departed, and went to the most principall lodging that the king had
within all his palace, breaking vp the lockes and doores, and so lodged himselfe therein,
more like to a king than a duke, continuing in the same lodging for a time to the
great indignation of manie, that could not in aniewise like of such presumptuous
attempts made by the duke, to thrust himselfe in possession of the crowne, and to
depose king Henrie, who had reigned ouer them so long a time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Edw. Hall. in Hen. 6. fol.</i> clxxvij, &amp;c.</div>

either at this his first comming in amongst them, or else at some one time after, the
which we haue thought good also to set downe: though Iohn Whethamsted the abbat

for the oration (as maister Hall hath written thereof) we find as followeth. &para; During
the time (saith he) of this parlement, the duke of Yorke with a bold countenance
entered into the chamber of the p&eacute;eres, and sat downe in the throne roiall, vnder the

as well spirituall as temporall (after a pause made) he began to declare his title to the

<p>For vndoubtedlie, the root and bottome of this long festured canker is not yet extirpate,
nor the f&eacute;eble foundation of this fallible building is not yet espied, which hath
b&eacute;ene and is the dailie destruction of the nobilitie, and the continuall confusion of the
poore communaltie of this realme and kingdome. For all you know (or should know)
that the high and mightie prince king Richard the second, was the true and vndoubted
heire to the valiant conqueror and renowmed prince king Edward the third, as sonne
&amp; heire to the hardie knight and couragious capteine Edward prince of Wales, duke
of Aquitaine and Cornewall, eldest sonne to the said king Edward the third: which
king was not onelie in d&eacute;ed, but also of all men reputed and taken for the true and
infallible heire to the wise and politike prince king Henrie the third, as sonne and

Lionell duke of Clarence, the third begotten sonne of the said king Edward, by
force and violence, contrarie both to the dutie of his allegiance, and also to his homage
to him both doone and sworne, raised warre and battell at the castle of Flint
in Northwales, against the said king Richard, and him apprehended, and imprisoned

<p>And not therewith satisfied, and contented, compassed and accomplished the death

descent all you can not iustlie gainesay, nor yet trulie denie. Then remember this, if
the title be mine, why am I put from it? If I be true heire to the crowne (as I am in
d&eacute;ed) why is my right withholden? If my claime be good, why haue I not iustice?
For suerlie, learned men of great science and knowledge say and affirme, that lineall
descent, nor vsurped possession can nothing preuaile, if continuall claime be
lawfullie made, or openlie published.</p>

<p>For the auoiding of which scruple and ambiguitie: Edmund earle of March my
most welbeloued vncle, in the time of the first vsurper, in d&eacute;ed but not by right
called king Henrie the fourth, by his coosines the earle of Northumberland, &amp; the
lord Persie, he being then in captiuitie with Owen Glendouer the rebell in Wales,
made his title &amp; righteous claime to the destruction of both the noble persons. Likewise
my most d&eacute;erest lord and father, so farre set foorth that right and title, that he
lost his life &amp; worldlie ioy at the towne of Southampton, more by power than indifferent
iustice. Since whose death, I comming to my full age, haue neuer desisted
to pursue my title, and require my right, which by meanes of sinister counsell and
vniust detention, I can neither obteine nor recouer. So that of fine force I am compelled
to vse power in st&eacute;ed of praier, and force in st&eacute;ed of request; not (as I said
before) for my priuat emolument and peculiar profit: but to restore peace, loue, and
quietnesse to this our naturall region, which euer since the first vngodlie vsurpation
of the aforenamed Henrie, vntrulie called king Henrie the fourth, hath b&eacute;ene cl&eacute;erelie
banished, and out of the same vniustlie exiled.</p>

<p>What murthers and manslaughters haue b&eacute;ene perpetrated and committed within
this countrie, since the beginning of that vngratious vsurpation? What number of
noble men haue b&eacute;ene slaine, destroied, &amp; executed since that unfortunate daie? It is
too lamentable and manifest. For although Henrie of Lancaster earle of Derbie tooke
vpon him the scepter and the crowne, and wrongfullie bare the name and stile of a
king; and was not much tickled with mine vncle the earle of March, at that time being
within age: yet was he neuer in suertie of himselfe, nor had or inioied any profit
&amp; quietnesse either in mind or in bodie. "For suerlie, a corrupt conscience neuer
f&eacute;eleth rest, but looketh when the sword of vengeage will descend and strike." His
sonne also called king Henrie the fift, obteined notable victories, and immortal praises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
for his noble acts doone in the realme of France: yet God (for the offense of his vntrue
parent) suddenlie touched him, vnbodieng his soule in the flower of his youth,
and in the glorie of his conquest.</p>

<p>And although he had a faire sonne and a yoong heire apparant: yet was this orphan
such a one (as preachers say) that God threatned to send for a punishment to his vnrulie
and vngratious people, saieng by his prophet Esaie; "I shall giue you children
to be your princes, and infants without wisedome shall haue the gouernance of you."
The prophet lied not, if you note all things in an order: for after this Henrie the fift
(whose fame no man can iustlie reprooue or deface) succ&eacute;eded his sonne, whom all
we haue called our naturall prince, and obeied as his heire. In whose time and wrongfull
reigne, I require you diligentlie to consider, with what great torments and afflictions
God hath whipped &amp; scourged this miserable Ile: yea with such and so
manie scourges and plagues, as no nation (the &AElig;gyptians onelie excepted) were euer
tormented or afflicted withall. I will not speake of rebellious murthers and oppressions,
which of late haue b&eacute;ene doone and exercised h&eacute;ere among vs. But I will
declare &amp; manifest to you, how the crowne and glorie of this realme is by the negligence
of this sillie man, and his vnwise councell minished, defaced, and also dishonoured.</p>

<p>Is not Normandie, which his father gat, regained &amp; conquered againe, by the insolencie
of him &amp; his couetous councell? Is not the whole duchie of Aquitaine, by
two hundred and od yeares peaceablie possessed by the kings of this realme, in one
yeare and a little more, gotten out of our hands &amp; seigniorie? What should I speak
of Aniou &amp; Maine, or the losse of the Ile of France, with the rich citie of Paris.
Alas it is too apparant. Neither will I molest you with the recitall of all the particulars
thereof. But now in the middest of this affliction, and to make an end of the
same: God of his ineffable goodnesse, looking on this countrie with his eies of pitie
&amp; mercie, hath sent me in the truth, to restore againe this decaid kingdome to his
ancient fame and old renowme whereof h&eacute;ere in open parlement, according to my iust
&amp; true title, I haue and doo take possession of this roiall throne: not putting diffidence,
but firme hope in Gods grace, that by his diuine aid, and assistance of you
the p&eacute;eres of this realme, I shall beautifie &amp; mainteine the same to the glorie of him,
honour of my bloud, and to the publike wealth as well of you all h&eacute;ere present, as of
all the poore commons and subiects of this kingdome and regiment.</p>

<p>When the duke had made an end of his oration, the lords sat still as men striken into
a certeine amazednesse, neither whispering nor speaking foorth a word, as though
their mouthes had b&eacute;ene sowed vp. The duke not verie well content with their silence,
aduised them to consider throughlie, and ponder the whole effect of his words
and saiengs: and so neither fullie displeased, nor yet altogither content, departed to
his lodging in the kings palace. While he was declaring thus his title in the higher
house among the p&eacute;eres, there happened a strange chance in the verie same instant
amongest the commons in the nether house. A crowne which did hang in the middle
of the same, to garnish a branch to set lights vpon, without touch of man, or blast
of wind, suddenlie fell downe. About the same time also fell downe the crowne
which stood on the top of Douer castell. Which chances where construed to be signes,
that the crowne of the realme should some waie haue a fall.</p>

for the death of Edmund duke of Summerset his moothers brother, this yeare besieged
the castell of Roxburgh: and by the breaking of a bombard, as the same was
shot off against the castell, he chanced to be slaine. Yet the Scots left not off their

<p>After long debating of the matter and deliberate consultation amongest the p&eacute;eres,
prelats, and commons, vpon the vigill of all saints, it was condescended: for so much
as king Henrie had b&eacute;ene taken as king by the space of thirtie and eight yeares and

during his naturall life. And if he either died, or resigned, or forfeited the same, by

<p>Blessed be Iesu, in whose hands and bountie resteth and is the peace and vnitie
betwixt princes, and the weale of euerie realme: by whose direction (I know) agr&eacute;ed
it is, appointed, and accorded as followeth, betwixt the most high and most mightie
prince king Henrie the sixt, king of England and of France, and lord of Ireland, on
the one partie, and the right high &amp; mightie prince Richard Plantagenet duke of
Yorke on the other partie: vpon certeine matters of variance mooued betwixt them,
and especiallie vpon the claime and title vnto the crownes of England and of France, and
roiall power, estate and dignitie apperteining to the same, and lordship of Ireland,
opened, shewed, and declared by the said duke, before all the lords spirituall and temporall,
being in this present parlement.</p>

<p>First, where the said Richard duke of Yorke hath declared and opened (as his aboue
said) title &amp; claime in maner as followeth.</p>

<p>That the right noble and woorthie prince, Henrie king of England the third had
issue, and lawfullie got Edward the first begotten sonne, borne at Westminster, the
fift&eacute;enth kalends of Iulie, in the yeare of our Lord 1239, &amp; Edmund his second sonne
which was borne on S. Marcels daie, the yere 1245, the which Edward, after the death
of king Henrie his father, intituled &amp; called king Edward the first, had issue, Edward
his first begotten sonne, called (after the deceasse of his father) king Edward the second,
the which had issue, Edward the third; which Edward the third had issue, Edward
prince of Wales; William of Hatfield his second sonne; Lionell the third, duke of
Clarence; Iohn of Gant, fourth duke of Lancaster; Edmund of Langlie fift, duke of
Yorke; Thomas of Woodstoke sixt, duke of Glocester; and William of Windsor
seauenth.</p>

<p>The said Edward prince of Wales, which died in the life time of his father, had
issue Richard, which succ&eacute;eded Edward the third his grandsire; Richard died without
issue; William of Hatfield the second sonne of Edward the third, died without issue;
Lionell the third sonne of Edward the third, duke of Clarence, had issue Philip his
daughter and heire, which was coupled in matrimonie vnto Edmund Mortimer earle
of March, and had issue Roger Mortimer earle of March hir sonne and heire; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Roger had issue of Edmund erle of March, Roger Mortimer, Anne, Elianor; which
Edmund, Roger, and Elianor died without issue.</p>

<p>And the said Anne coupled in matrimonie to Richard earle of Cambridge, the sonne
of Edmund of Langleie, the fift sonne of Henrie the third, and had issue Richard Plantagenet,
commonlie called duke of Yorke; Iohn of Gant, the fourth sonne of Edward
and the yoonger brother of the said Lionell, had issue Henrie earle of Derbie, who
incontinentlie after that king Richard resigned the crownes of the realmes and lordship
of Ireland, vnrighteouslie entered vpon the same, then being aliue Edmund Mortimer
earle of March, sonne to Roger Mortimer earle of March, sonne and heire of
the said Philip, daughter and heire of the said Lionell, the third sonne of the said
king Edward the third, to the which Edmund the right and title of the said crownes
and lordship by law and custome belonged. To the which Richard duke of Yorke,
as sonne to Anne daughter to Roger Mortimer earle of March, sonne and heire of the
said Philip, daughter and heire of the said Lionell, the third sonne of king Edward
the third, the right, title, dignitie roiall, and estate of the crownes of the realmes of
England and France, and the lordship of Ireland perteineth and belongeth afore anie
issue of the said Iohn of Gant, the fourth sonne of the same king Edward.</p>

<p>The said title notwithstanding, and without preiudice of the said Richard duke of
Yorke, tenderlie desiring the wealth, rest, and prosperitie of this land, and to set apart
all that might be trouble to the same, and considering the possession of the said king
Henrie the sixt, and that he hath for his time b&eacute;ene named, taken, and reputed for
king of England and of France, and lord of Ireland, is contented, agr&eacute;ed, and consenteth,
that he be had, reputed, and taken for king of England and France, with the
roiall estate, dignitie, and preheminence belonging therevnto, and lord of Ireland
during his naturall life. And for that time, the said duke, without hurt or preiudice of
his said right, and title, shall take, worship, and honour him for his souereigne lord.</p>

<p>Item, the said Richard duke of Yorke, shall promit and bind him by his solemne
oth, in maner and forme as followeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The oth of Richard duke of Yorke.</div>

<p>In the name of God Amen: I Richard duke of Yorke, promise and sweare by the
faith and truth that I owe to almightie God, that I shall neuer consent, procure, or
stirre, directlie or indirectlie, in priuie or apert, neither (as much as in me is) shall
suffer to be doone, consented, procured, or stirred, anie thing that may sound to the
abridgement of the naturall life of king Henrie the sixt, or to the hurt or diminishing
of his reigne or dignitie roiall, by violence, or anie other waie, against his fr&eacute;edome
or libertie: but if any person or persons would doo or presume anie thing to the contrarie,
I shall with all my might and power withstand it, and make it to be withstood,
as far as my power will stretch therevnto, so helpe me God and his holie euangelists.</p>

<p>Item, Edward earle of March, and Edmund earle of Rutland, sonnes of the said
duke of Yorke, shall make like oth.</p>

<p>Item, it is accorded, appointed, and agr&eacute;ed that the said Richard duke of Yorke,
shall be called and reputed from hencefoorth, verie and rightfull heire to the crownes,
roiall estate, dignitie and lordship aboue said; and after the deceasse of the said king
Henrie, or when he will laie from him the said crownes, estate, dignitie, and lordship,
the said duke and his heires shall immediatlie succ&eacute;ed to the said crownes, roiall estate,
dignitie and lordship.</p>

<p>Item, the said Richard duke of Yorke, shall haue by authoritie of this present
parlement, castels, manors, lands, and tenements, with the wards, marriages, reliefes,

his yearlie sustentation, in such consideration and such intent as shall be declared by
the lords of the kings councell.</p>

<p>Item, if anie person or persons imagine or compasse the death of the said duke, and
thereof probablie be attainted of open d&eacute;ed doone by folkes of other condition, that it

<p>Item, for the more establishing of the said accord, it is appointed and consented,
that the lords spirituall and temporall, being in this present parlement, shall make oths,
to accept, take, worship, and repute the said Richard duke of Yorke and his heires,
as aboue is rehearsed, and k&eacute;epe, obserue, and strengthen (in as much as apperteineth
vnto them) all the things abouesaid, and resist to their power, all them that would presume
the contrarie, according to their estates and degr&eacute;es.</p>

<p>Item, the said Richard duke of Yorke, earles of March, and Rutland, shall permit
and make other to helpe, aid, and defend the said lords, and euerie of them against
all those that will quarell, or anie thing attempt against the said lords, or anie of them,
by occasion of agr&eacute;ement or consenting to the said accord, or assistance giuing to the
duke and earles, or anie of them.</p>

<p>Item, it is agr&eacute;ed and appointed, that this accord, and euerie article thereof, be
opened and notified by the kings letters patents, or otherwise, at such times and places,
and in maner as it shall be thought expedient to the said Richard duke of Yorke, with
the aduise of the lords of the kings councell. The king vnderstandeth certeinelie the
said title of the said Richard duke of Yorke, iust, lawfull, and sufficient, by the aduise
and assent of the lords spirituall and temporall, and the commons in this parlement
assembled; and by authoritie of the same parlement declareth, approoueth, ratifieth,
confirmeth, and accepteth the said title, iust, good, lawfull, and true, and therevnto

<p>And moreouer, by the said aduise and authoritie, establisheth, granteth, confirmeth,

<p>And ouer this, the king by the said aduise, assent and authoritie, ordeineth and
establisheth, that all other acts and statutes made afore this time by act of parlement,
not repealed or annulled by like authoritie, or otherwise void, be in such force, effect,
and vertue, as they were afore the making of these ordinances; and that no letters

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Yorke proclaimed heire apparant &amp; protectour of the realme.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The parleme&#x0304;t at Couentrie made frustrat.</div>

<p>This agr&eacute;ement put in articles, was ingrossed, sealed, and sworne vnto by the two
parties, and also enacted in the parlement. For ioy whereof the king, hauing in his
companie the duke of Yorke, road to the cathedrall church of saint Paule in London,
and there on the day of all saints with the crowne on his head went solemnelie in
procession, and was lodged a good space after in the bishops palace, n&eacute;er to the said
church. And vpon the saturdaie next insuing, Richard duke of Yorke was by sound
of trumpet solemnelie proclamed heire apparant to the crowne of England, and
protectour of the realme. After this, the parlement kept at Couentrie the last yeare,
was declared to be a diuelish councell, and onelie had for destruction of the nobilitie,
and was ind&eacute;ed no lawfull parlement: bicause they which were returned, were neuer
elected according to the due order of the law, but secretlie named by them which desired
rather the destruction than the aduancement of the common-wealth. When these
agr&eacute;ements were enacted, the king dissolued his parlement, which was the last parlement
that euer he ended.</p>

<p>The duke of Yorke, well knowing that the qu&eacute;ene would spurne against all this,
caused both hir and hir sonne to be sent for by the king. But she as woont rather to
rule, than to be ruled, and thereto counselled by the dukes of Excester and Summerset
not onelie denied to come, but also assembled a great armie, intending to take the
king by fine force out of the lords hands. The protector in London hauing knowledge
of all these dooings, assigned the duke of Norffolke, and erle of Warwike his
trustie fr&eacute;ends to be about the king, while he with the earles of Salisburie and Rutland
and a conuenient number departed out of London the second daie of December
northward, and appointed the earle of March his eldest sonne to follow him with all
his power. The duke came to his castell of Sandall beside Wakefield on Christmasse
&eacute;euen, &amp; there began to make muster of his tenants and fr&eacute;ends. The qu&eacute;ene thereof
ascertained, determined to cope with him yer his succour were come.</p>

<p>Now she, hauing in hir companie the prince hir sonne, the dukes of Excester and
Summerset, the earle of Deuonshire, the lord Clifford, the lord Ros, and in effect all
the lords of the north parts, with eight&eacute;ene thousand men, or (as some write) two
and twentie thousand, marched from Yorke to Wakefield, and bad base to the duke,
euen before his castell gates. He hauing with him not fullie fiue thousand persons,
contrarie to the minds of his faithfull councellors, would n&eacute;eds issue foorth to fight
with his enimies. The duke of Summerset and the qu&eacute;enes part, casting vpon their
most aduantage, appointed the lord Clifford to lie in one stale, and the earle of Wilshire
in another, and the duke with other to k&eacute;epe the manie battell. The duke of
Yorke with his people descended downe the hill in good order and arraie, and was
suffered to passe on towards the maine battell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Onelie seauen hundred southerne men saith <i>Whethamsted</i>.</div>

<p>But when he was in the plaine field betw&eacute;ene his castell and the towne of Wakefield,
he was inuironed on euerie side, like fish in a net, so that though he fought
manfullie, yet was he within halfe an houre slaine and dead, and his whole armie
discomfited: with him died of his trustie fr&eacute;ends, his two bastard vncles, sir Iohn
and sir Hugh Mortimers, sir Dauie Hall, sir Hugh Hastings, sir Thomas Neuill,
William and Thomas Aparre, both brethren; and two thousand and eight hundred
others, whereof manie were yoong gentlemen, and heires of great parentage in the
south parts, whose kin reuenged their deaths within foure moneths next, as after
shall appeare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cruell murther of the yoong earle of Rutland.</div>

<p>In this conflict was wounded and taken prisoner, Richard earle of Salisburie, sir
Richard Limbricke, Rafe Stanleie, Iohn Harow, capteine Hanson, and diuerse others.
The lord Clifford, perceiuing where the earle of Rutland was conueied out of the field
(by one of his fathers chapleins, and scholemaister to the same earle) and ouertaking
him, stabbed him to the heart with a dagger as he kn&eacute;eled afore him. This earle was
but a child at that time of twelue yeares of age, whome neither his tender yeares,
nor dolorous countenance, with holding vp both his hands for mercie (for his speach
was gone for feare) could mooue the cruell heart of the lord Clifford to take pitie vpon
him, so that he was noted of great infamie for that his vnmercifull murther vpon that
yoong gentleman.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<p>But the same lord Clifford not satisfied herewith, came to the place where the dead
corpse of the duke of Yorke laie, caused his head to be striken off, and set on it a
crowne of paper, fixed it to a pole and presented it on the qu&eacute;ene, not lieng farre
from the field, in great despite, at which great reioising was shewed: but they laughed
then that shortlie after lamented, and were glad then of other mens deaths that
knew not their owne to be so n&eacute;ere at hand. &para; Some write that the duke was taken
aliue, and in derision caused to stand vpon a molehill, on whose head they put a
garland in st&eacute;ed of a crowne, which they had fashioned and made of sedges or
bulrushes; and hauing so crowned him with that garland, they kn&eacute;eled downe afore
him (as the Iewes did vnto Christ) in scorne, saieng to him; "Haile king without rule,
haile king without heritage, haile duke and prince without people or possessions." And
at length hauing thus scorned him with these and diuerse other the like despitefull
words, they stroke off his head, which (as y&eacute;e haue heard) they presented to the
qu&eacute;ene.</p>

<p>Manie d&eacute;emed that this miserable end chanced to the duke of Yorke, as a due

but others held him discharged thereof, bicause he obteined a dispensation from the
pope, by such suggestion as his procurators made vnto him, whereby the same oth
was adiudged void, as that which was receiued vnaduisedlie, to the preiudice of himselfe,
and disheriting of all his posteritie. After this victorie by the qu&eacute;ene, the earle
of Salisburie and all the prisoners were sent to Pomfret, and there beheaded, whose
heads (togither with the duke of Yorkes head) were conueied to Yorke, and there set
on poles ouer the gate of the citie, in despite of them and their linage. The earle of
March, now after the death of his father, verie duke of Yorke, lieng at Glocester,
was woonderfullie amazed, when the sorrowfull newes of these mishaps came vnto
him: but after comfort giuen to him by his faithfull louers and assured alies, he
remooued to Shrewesburie, declaring to the inhabitants of that towne, and to them
of the other townes in those parties the murther of his father, the ieopardie of himselfe,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The battell of Mortimers crosse.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The cognisa&#x0304;ce of bright sunne.</div>

<p>The people on the marches of Wales, for the fauour which they bare to the Mortimers
linage, more gladlie offered him their aid and assistance than he could desire
the same; so that he had incontinentlie a puissant armie, to the number of thr&eacute;e and
twentie thousand, readie to go against the qu&eacute;ene, and the murtherers of his
father. But when he was setting forward, newes was brought to him, that Iasper
earle of Penbroke halfe brother to king Henrie, and Iames Butler earle of Ormund
and Wilshire, had assembled a great number of Welsh and Irish people to take him:
he herewith quickned, retired backe and met with his enimies in a faire plaine, n&eacute;ere to
Mortimers crosse, not far from Hereford east, on Candlemasse daie in the morning.
At which time the sunne (as some write) appeared to the earle of March like thr&eacute;e
sunnes, and suddenlie ioined altogither in one. Vpon which sight he tooke such
courage, that he fiercelie setting on his enimies, put them to flight: and for this
cause men imagined, that he gaue the sunne in his full brightnesse for his badge or
cognisance. Of his enimies were left dead on the ground thr&eacute;e thousand and eight
hundred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Owen Teuther and other taken and beheaded.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whethamsted.</i></div>

<p>The earles of Penbroke and Wilshire fled, but sir Owen Teuther father to the said
earle of Penbroke (which Owen had married king Henries mother, as y&eacute;e haue heard
before) with Dauid Floid, Morgan ap Reuther, and diuerse other were taken, and beheaded
at Hereford. The qu&eacute;ene neuer the lesse incouraged by hir late victorie, with
a multitude of northerne people, marched toward London, intending to vndoo all that
had b&eacute;ene ordeined in the last parlement. These northerne people, after they were
once passed ouer the riuer of Trent, spoiled and wasted the countrie afore them, in
maner as if they had b&eacute;ene in the land of forren enimies. At length, they approched
to saint Albons, hearing that the duke of Northfolke, and the earle of Warwike, with
other whome the duke of Yorke had left to gouerne the king in his absence, had
(by the kings assent) assembled a great hoast, and were incamped n&eacute;ere to that
towne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The northern men enter into S. Albons.</div>

<div class="sidenote">They passe through it.</div>

<p>Those northerne lords and other that were with the qu&eacute;ene, made forward, and
entring into S. Albons, meant to passe through the towne, and so to coape with their
enimies; but finding a sort of archers ranged n&eacute;ere to the great crosse in the market
place, to defend their passage, they were receiued with such a storme of arrowes,
which came flieng about their eares as thicke as haile, that they were quicklie repelled
backe, and with losse driuen to retire in hast vnto the west end of the towne; where
by a lane that leadeth northwards vp to saint Peters str&eacute;et, they made their entrie, and
had there also a sharpe incounter against certeine bands of the kings people. But
after great slaughter on both parts, they got through, and vpon the heath that lieth
at the north end of the towne, called Barnard heath, they had a farre greater conflict
with foure or fiue thousand of the kings armie, that s&eacute;emed as they had b&eacute;ene auant
courrers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The second battell at S. Albons.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The kings part fl&eacute;eth.</div>

<p>These gaue the onset so fiercelie at the beginning, that the victorie rested doubtfull
a certeine time, so that if the easterne and southerne men had continued as they began,
the field had b&eacute;ene theirs; but after they had stood to it a pretie while, and perceiued
none of their fellowes from the great armie to come and assist them, they began to
faint, and turning their backes, fled amaine ouer hedge and ditch, through thicke and
thin, woods and bushes, s&eacute;eking so to escape the hands of their cruell enimies that followed
them with eger minds, to make slaughter vpon them, namelie, the northern
prickers, now in the chase pursued most hotlie, and bare downe manie, and more had
doone, if the night comming vpon, had not staied them.</p>

<p>When the daie was closed, those that were about the king (in number a twentie
thousand) hearing how euill their fellowes had sped, began vtterlie to despair of the
victorie, and so fell without anie long tarriance to running awaie. By reason whereof,
the nobles that were about the king, perceiuing how the game went, and withall saw
no comfort in the king, but rather a good will and affection towards the contrarie
part, they withdrew also, leauing the king accompanied with the lord Bonneuille, &amp;
sir Thomas Kiriell of Kent; which vpon assurance of the kings promise, tarried still
with him, and fled not. But their trust deceiued them, for at the qu&eacute;enes departing
from saint Albons, they were both beheaded; though contrarie to the mind and promise
of hir husband. Sir Thomas Thorp, baron of the escheker, was also beheaded
the same daie, at Highgate, by the commons of Kent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1916, as <i>Iohn Stow</i> noteth.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Iohn Graie slaine.</div>

<p>Such was the successe of this second battell fought at S. Albons, vpon Shrouetuesdaie,
the seuent&eacute;enth of Februarie, in which were slaine thr&eacute;e and twentie hundred men,
of whom no noble man is remembred, saue sir Iohn Graie, which the same
daie was made knight, with twelue other, at the village of Colneie. Now after
that the noble men and other were fled, and the king left in maner alone without anie
power of men to gard his person, he was counselled by an esquier called Thomas
Hoo, a man well languaged, and well s&eacute;ene in the lawes, to send some conuenient
messenger to the northerne lords, aduertising them, that he would now gladlie come
vnto them (whome he knew to be his verie fr&eacute;ends, and had assembled themselues
togither for his seruice) to the end he might remaine with them, as before he had
remained vnder the gouernement of the southerne lords.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas Hoo esquier sent to the northerne lords.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Edw. Hall.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Prince Edward made knight.</div>

<p>According to the aduise and counsell of this esquier, the king thought it good to
send vnto them, and withall appointed the same esquier to beare the message, who
first went and declared the same vnto the earle of Northumberland, and returning
backe to the king, brought certeine lords with him, who conueied the king first vnto
the lord Cliffords tent, that stood next to the place where the kings people had incamped.
This done, they went and brought the qu&eacute;ene and hir sonne prince Edward vnto his
presence, whome he ioifullie receiued, imbracing and kissing them in most louing wise,
and y&eacute;elding hartie thanks to almightie God, whome it had pleased thus to strengthen
the forces of the northerne men, to restore his d&eacute;erlie belooued and onelie sonne againe
into his possession. Thus was the qu&eacute;ene fortunate in hir two battels, but vnfortunate
was the king in all his enterprises: for where his person was present, the victorie still
fled from him to the contrarie part. The qu&eacute;ene caused the king to dub hir sonne
prince Edward knight, with thirtie other persons, which the day before fought on hir
side against his part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The northern men spoile the towne of saint Albons.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;ene sendeth to the maior of London for vittels.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Vittels sent by the maior and staid by the commons.</div>

<p>This doone, they went to abbeie, where, of the abbat and moonks they were
receiued with hymnes and songs, and so brought to the high altar, and after to the
shrine, and so to the chamber in which the king was woont to lodge. The abbat
made sute that order might be taken to restreine the northerne men from spoiling the
towne: and proclamation ind&eacute;ed was made to that effect, but it auailed not: for they
mainteined, that the spoile of things was granted them by couenant, after they were
once passed ouer the riuer of Trent: and so not regarding anie proclamation or other
commandement, they spared nothing that they could laie hands vpon, if the same
were m&eacute;et for them to carie awaie. The qu&eacute;ene, hauing thus got the victorie, sent
to the maior of London, commanding him without delaie to send certeine carts, laden
with Lenton vittels, for the refreshing of hir and hir armie. The maior incontinentlie
caused carts to be laden, and would haue sent them forward; but the commons of the
citie would not suffer them to passe, but staied them at Criplegate, notwithstanding
the maior did what he could by gentle persuasions to quiet them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;ene returneth northward.</div>

<p>During which controuersie, diuerse of the northerne horssemen, came and robbed
in the suburbs of the citie, and would haue entred at Criplegate; but they were repelled
by the commoners, and thr&eacute;e of them slaine. Wherevpon, the maior sent
the recorder to Barnet to the kings counsell there, to excuse the matter; and the
duches of Bedford, the ladie Scales, with diuerse fathers of the spiritualtie, went to
the qu&eacute;ene, to asswage hir displeasure conceiued against the citie. The qu&eacute;ene at
this humble request, by aduise of hir councell, appointed certeine lords and knights,
with foure hundred tall persons, to ride to the citie, and there to view and s&eacute;e the
demeanor and disposition of the people: and diuerse aldermen were appointed to
m&eacute;et them at Barnet, and to conueie them to London. But what man purposeth,
God disposeth. All these deuises were shortlie altered to another forme, bicause true
report came not onelie to the qu&eacute;ene, but also to the citie; that the earle of March,
hauing vanquished the earles of Penbroke and Wilshire, had met with the earle
of Warwike (after this last battell at saint Albons) at Chipping Norton by Cotsold;
and that they with both their powers were coming toward London. The qu&eacute;ene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
hauing little trust in Essex, and lesse in Kent, but least of all in London, with hir
husband and sonne, departed from saint Albons, into the north countrie, where the
foundation of hir aid and refuge onelie rested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The great hope of the people conceiued of the erle of March.</div>

<p>The duches of Yorke, s&eacute;eing hir husband and sonne slaine, and not knowing what
should succ&eacute;ed of hir eldest sonnes chance, sent hir two yonger sonnes, George and
Richard, ouer the sea, to the citie of Utrecht in Almaine, where they were of Philip
duke of Burgognie well receiued; and so remained there, till their brother Edward
had got the crowne and gouernement of the realme. The earles of March and Warwike,
hauing perfect knowlege that the king &amp; qu&eacute;ene, with their adherents, were
departed from S. Albons, rode straight to London, entring there with a great number
of men of warre, the first w&eacute;eke of Lent. Whose co&#x0304;ming thither was no sooner
knowne, but that the people resorted out of Kent, Essex, and other the counties
adioining, in great numbers, to s&eacute;e, aid, and comfort this lustie prince and flower of
chiualrie, in whome the hope of their ioy and trust of their quietnesse onelie consisted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of March elected king.</div>

<p>This prudent yoong prince, minding to take time when time serued, called a great
councell, both of the lords spirituall and temporall, and to them repeated the title and
right that he had to the crowne, rehearsing also the articles concluded betw&eacute;ene
king Henrie and his father, by their writings signed and sealed, and also confirmed
by act of parlement; the breaches whereof he neither forgat, nor left vndeclared.
After the lords had considered of this matter, they determined by authoritie of the
said councell, that because king Henrie had doone contrarie to the ordinances in the
last parlement concluded, and was insufficient of himselfe to rule the realme, he was
therfore to be depriued of all kinglie estate: and incontinentlie was Edward earle of
March, sonne and heire to Richard duke of Yorke, by the lords in the said councell
assembled, named, elected, and admitted for king and gouernour of the realme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Fauconbridge.</div>

<p>On which daie, the people of the earles part, being in their muster in S. Iohns field,
and a great number of the substantiall citizens there assembled, to behold their order;
the lord Fauconbridge, who tooke the musters, wiselie anon declared to the people
the offenses and breaches of the late agr&eacute;ement, committed by king Henrie the sixt;
and demanded of the people, whether they would haue him to rule and reigne anie
longer ouer them? To whome they with whole voice answered; Naie, naie. Then he
asked them, if they would serue, loue, honour, and obeie the erle of March, as their
onlie king and souereigne lord: To which question they answered; Yea, yea: crieng
(king Edward) with manie great shouts &amp; clapping of hands in assent and gladnesse
of the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of March taketh vpon him as king.</div>

<p>The lords were shortlie aduertised of the louing consent which the commons
frankelie and fr&eacute;elie had giuen. Whervpon incontinentlie, they all with a conuenient
number of the most substantiall commons repaired to the erle at Bainards castell,
making iust and true report of their election and admission, and the louing assent of
the commons. The earle, after long pausing, first thanked God of his great grace
and benefit towards him shewed; then the lords and commons for their fauour and
fidelitie: notwithstanding, like a wise prince, he alleged his insufficiencie for so great
a roome and weightie burthen, as lacke of knowledge, want of experience, and diuerse
other qualities to a gouernour appertaining. But yet in conclusion, being persuaded
by the archbishop of Canturburie, the bishop of Excester, and other lords then
present, he agr&eacute;ed to their petition, and tooke vpon him the charge of the kingdome,
as forfeited to him by breach of the couenants established in parlement:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Flem.</i></div>

<p>&para; Thus farre touching the tragicall state of this land vnder the rent regiment of
king Henrie, who (besides the bare title of roialtie and naked name of king) had little
appertaining to the port of a prince. For whereas the dignitie of princedome standeth
in souereigntie; there were of his nobles that imbecilled his prerogatiue by sundrie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
practises, speciallie by maine force; as s&eacute;eking either to suppresse, or to exile, or to
obscure, or to make him awaie: otherwise what should be the meaning of all those
foughten fields from time to time, most miserablie falling out both to prince, p&eacute;ere,
and people? As at saint Albons, at Bloreheath, at Northampton, at Banberie, at
Barnet, &amp; at Wakefield; to the effusion of much bloud, and pulling on of manie a
plage, which otherwise might haue b&eacute;ene auoided. All which battels, togither with
those that were tried betw&eacute;ene Edward the fourth, after his inthronization; and
Henrie the sixt after his extermination (as at Exham, Doncaster, and Teukesburie)
are remembred by Anglorum pr&aelig;lia in good order of pithie poetrie, as followeth:</p>

<p>Thomas Dando, a Carmelit frier of Marleburgh, he wrote the life of Alphred king
of west Saxons; William Graie, borne of the noble house of the Graies of Codnor,
he went to atteine to some excellencie of learning in Italie, where he heard that noble
clearke Guarinus Veronensis read in Ferrara, he was preferred to the bishoprike of
Elie, in the y&eacute;ere 1454, by pope Nicholas the fift, when Thomas Bourchier was translated

of S. Albin, by pope Eugenie the fourth; Adam Molins (as Bale calleth him) k&eacute;eper
of the kings priuie seale, excellentlie learned, in time of the ciuill warre betwixt
king Henrie, and the duke of Yorke, in which he lost his head.</p>

<p>Thomas Chillenden, a doctor both of the law ciuill and canon, became at length a
moonke in Canturburie; Robert Bale, surnamed the elder, excellentlie learned in the
lawes of the realme, recorder of London, gathered as it were a chronicle of the
customes, lawes, foundations, changes, restoring magistrats, offices, orders, and publike
assemblies of the citie of London, with other matters, touching the perfect description
of the same citie; he wrote other works also touching the state of the same
citie, and the acts of king Edward the third; he departed this life in the yeare of our
Lord 1461, euen about the beginning of the reigne of king Edward the fourth, vnto
whome we will now againe returne.</p>
